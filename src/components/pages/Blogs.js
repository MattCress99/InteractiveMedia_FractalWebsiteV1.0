              A critical analysis of Faith, a kinetic poem written by Robert
              Kendal

              The "Electronic Literature Collection” is a library of internet
              artworks. The artworks compose of various images, videos and
              pieces of literature that all utilize their digital format to
              create a unique experience for the audience. The website has an
              old school retro style layout with various web artworks arranged
              in a grid. The website is subtle and looks like it was designed in
              1997 using HTML 2.0 and Adobe Photoshop and never changed since. I
              like this as it gives the website the feel of being a true
              internet archive, and it reminds me of the original 4chan website
              design in many ways. After browsing the collection of artworks, I
              came across an image of old english calligraphy that was quite
              hard to read.I was drawn to the image because the calligraphy
              reminded me of my high school's church, which had similar
              calligraphy on the windows. Upon seeing that the words written in
              calligraphy on the image said “Faith” I knew this was the piece of
              web art I'd been looking for. Clicking on the image takes you to a
              new page where it gives you information about the artwork and an
              option to play the piece. “Faith” is a web art work described by
              the author, Robert Kendall, as a kinetic poem. I found this to be
              very intriguing. In High School, I was a member of the Anglican
              Church of Benoni and practiced as a Lay Minister at my High School
              church. Every morning I would read a prayer for the school during
              morning assemblies and on every Friday I would give a devotion to
              the school during our weekly Eucharist. I believe strongly that
              religion is dominated by practice rather than faith and that faith
              is not spoken about enough. Due to this the majority of my
              devotionals were focused around having Faith and trusting in the
              Lord and that you can find true strength in all religions through
              faith rather than by practice. In my after school hours I was a
              member of and in matric became the head of our schools creative
              writers guild. I particularly enjoy writing poetry during this
              time and have always found it to be my go to method of writing. I
              really enjoy the rhythm in it and because they are often short
              pieces I can put intention and meaning into it. This is why I knew
              that this artwork was the perfect choice.

            <p>
              Upon clicking “Begin” to play the artwork a window pops up that
              asks whether you would like to play the artwork with or without
              sound. I chose to play with sound in order to capture the full
              intentions of the author, its poetry after all, everything that is
              there is there for a reason. The artwork starts with the word
              'Faith' written in calligraphy at the top of the screen. The words
              'can't', 'logic', 'bend', 'this' float onto the screen and the
              scene ends with the words 'so…' appearing at the bottom of the
              screen which moves you to the next scene if clicked.. Everytime a
              word of the poem moves a sound is played, making the words of the
              poem the notes of this poem's song. So this is both a song as well
              as a poem. I found the words on screen very interesting, “Faith
              can't logic bend this”. In almost all cases of lost faith, it is
              logic that breaks a person's faith. These words remind me of a
              conversation I had with an old hippy looking man who was selling
              tie dye at a psytrance festival back in 2020. I was browsing
              through his clothing and started to have a conversation with him.
              I ended up talking to him for around an hour and we discussed
              various different things, but of all the things we spoke about the
              one thing that stood out was faith. He told me that humans are,
              through society, taught not to have faith. One of the first idols
              or omnipotent beings we are taught to believe in is Santa Claus.
              Everyone knows who Father Christmas is, and at some stage most of
              us believed faithfully that Santa Claus was real. But eventually
              we all have this faith ripped from underneath us, and we learn
              that our parents are actually Santa. This is the first time in
              your life that you are taught to place your faith into something
              false. This is why it is so hard to be faithful, once your trust
              has been broken once it is very hard to regain, as it is with
              Faith. Befitting that the author's first words are a question of
              whether logic can bend faith.{" "}
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Upon clicking to the next scene the other words from the poem
              begin to display themselves on screen. Now we see the 2nd version
              of this poem. Here the author asks the question, can't the mind
              push past logic to maintain faith? To move to the next scene, you
              click the words “Maybe, But…” which then reveals the rest of the
              poem. The poem speaks about the author's faith, and his struggles
              keeping it in today's logic driven society. But in the end he
              comes to the conclusion that it is one's own choice to have faith
              and that we must choose to make that leap of faith in order to
              achieve it, regardless of its consequences. With the poem ending
              in one word “Leap”. Text appears at the bottom saying “Now … ”,
              implying the question; what will happen now that you have faith?
              Clicking this causes all the words including faith to fall to the
              bottom of the screen, with four words “Just to sum up:” left
              standing. Here the author is telling us that in the end faith will
              fall. But the words that fall dont disappear, they remain there,
              just fallen. And this is how faith is, it will always be there.
              However, it is up to us to decide where our faith stands.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Overall I found this artwork to be extremely relatable and thought
              provoking. The author utilized the fact that this was a digital
              artwork to display his message. Through rearranging text from the
              poem and showing parts of the poem in sections the Author has
              utilized their digital platform far better than if it were written
              stanza for stanza on page. I felt that by making the poem a
              changing and interactable piece it created a unique experience for
              the viewer, one you could only get digitally or online and that it
              helped to deliver the author's message far more clearly and
              precisely. In an article written by David Carrier in 2020, he
              speaks about the value of digital art and the power the platform
              has to create a unique and valuable experience. He says “ What has
              changed is not just the display system, but the very nature of the
              artwork. Now it is not the unique artifact, but the reproductions
              that matter the most to the greatest number of viewers.” and this
              is true of “Faith”. The artwork has huge reproductive value due to
              the fact that anyone can view it without having to own the
              original copy. The artwork is created for the experience, it
              doesn't matter where the artwork is viewed from, every viewer will
              have their own unique and intended experience of the digital
              artwork.

            <h2>Core principles for design and aesthetics for the web</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              I was recently enlightened to the idea that a website is far more
              than just a plain old website. Websites at the core are
              collections of code compiled to create an interactable or visual
              user experience. According to 'Techopedia' a website “is a
              collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that
              share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained
              by an individual, group, business or organisation to serve a
              variety of purposes. Together, all publicly accessible websites
              constitute the World Wide Web.”
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              So you might be wondering what I mean by a website is far more
              than just a plain old website. Well, websites have the ability to
              create a significant societal impact. They are a platform for free
              speech and a domain to spread one's ideas, works and creations. It
              is a canvas for everyone. With the web being so easily accessible
              as well as the knowledge needed to create on the web, we are
              seeing more and more websites being created on a daily basis.
              Google alone has over 50 billion indexed webpages. (Please note
              there is a distinct difference between websites and webpages,
              websites are composed of individual webpages that link together to
              create the website.)
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              So with all these new website designers or Net-artists arising it
              is important to take note of what good web design is and what the
              core principles of design and aesthetics for the web are. I came
              across an article written by Ji Yong Park that was published in
              the 'Journal of Digital Design'. The article was called 'Design
              principles for interactive user experience through net art' and
              the paper talks about how net artists can use core design
              principles to construct a more user-centred design for the net
              art. Parks says that “Net art enables the designers to bridge the
              gap between traditional graphic design and interactive user
              experience in that it has empowered the users to be an interactive
              artist.” [1] The advantage of working on a web based platform to
              create art is that artists can make their work interactable
              through a digital environment. By creating an interactive user
              experience, net artists can create a far more impactful piece of
              work that the user can relate to and feel involved in.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              In reading this article I came across a fascinating website called
              'wwwwwwwww.Jodi.org'. The JODI site was created in 1994 by two net
              artists Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands)
              and Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). Bookchin and
              Shulgin (1999) describe that net art is 'a self-defining term
              created by a malfunctioning piece of software, originally used to
              describe an art and communications activity on the Internet.' [1]
              I feel that the JODI website is a perfect example of this. The
              website is composed of various fragments of html code that looks
              like a computer virus that would be depicted in a 90s hacker
              movie. The site is composed of various webpages of internet art
              that the user can interact with. The site itself doesn't seem to
              have much functionality besides taking the user through the
              various webpages of net art. Everything on the site appears to be
              some form of malfunctioning code or software, however it was
              intended to look that way by the creators. It is a perfect example
              of net art as it is online based, highly experimental and at the
              time it was created, unique. Net artists 'sought to break down
              autonomous disciplines and outmoded classifications imposed upon
              various activists practices.' The essence of net art is that it is
              highly experimental and pushes the boundaries of communication,
              cultural criticism and technology (Greene 2004) - [4]. The net
              itself is becoming more than just a browser, they declare that the
              Net is a temporary autonomous zone that supports anarchy and
              spontaneity in cyberspace. It has become a platform of untapped
              and uncontrolled creativity, a platform for free speech and
              unlimited design.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              What makes Net art so powerful is that the Internet user is not
              merely a viewer or guest but is actively involved in, and
              contributes to the net art experience - a unique situation, not
              often present in other media, and one that decentralises and
              breaks down hierarchies of authorship (Greene 2004) [4]. Net art
              challenges preconceived notions of what the web is, how it works
              and how users participate and experience life online. 4 key
              factors that designers must take into consideration when designing
              for the online environment are: Invisible design elements,
              collaborative participation, anarchic structure and non-linear
              communication.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              From the Form Art perspectives, web interface design should
              consider invisible or hidden design elements in terms of forming a
              user experience. Net artists do not define their works as artworks
              displayed on the screen or in the browser but use the technology
              inherent on the Internet as intrinsic elements of the art they
              produce. The beauty of Net art is that it does not construct those
              boundaries between the artists and the user. This is what makes
              Net art a truly interactive communication method where the user
              can participate in any points of the work process so that the user
              can be the artist and vice versa. The boundary between artist and
              audience is blurred when it comes to Net art and some even argue
              that there is no boundary, artist and audience are one and the
              same thing due to the interactive user experience that creates the
              artwork as well as the beauty in it. Artists and audiences become
              equal subjects as partners or coordinators in net art, thus the
              key issue in net art is not distribution and circulation, but
              communication. Communication is the key feature in net art that
              helps us to define and distinguish the boundaries between net
              artist and audience. Net art has no beginning or end, it is
              present continuously. Time based linear story obstructs user
              participation into net art, and this strictly lets users stay as
              the audience.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Net art is a radical form of activism and creativity that
              functions on a perfect platform for communication, design and free
              speech. The JODI site demonstrates that 'net art has become the
              latest stage for artists to construct experimental forms and
              narratives, challenge convention, initiate dialogs, introduce new
              stages, and threaten old paradigms' (Packer 1998). [2] With JODI
              being created in 1994 as one of the first widely recognised and
              praised net artworks, it shows that the platform has so much
              potential for greatness and is one that will continue to impact
              and advance social creativity in our life and the future of many
              others. Below I have attached links for 3 websites that I believe
              are excellent examples of Net art, I highly recommend going and
              checking them out, you wont regret it!

            <h2>Internet, Society and Design Justice</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Many individuals in today's society view the internet as a source
              of change and growth. It is a place where new ideas can grow and
              political and social movements can gain growth and followers. New
              philosophies can be published, criticised and viewed throughout
              the world. The internet has helped us all as a society to grow, it
              has created worldwide awareness on subjects such as identity,
              equality and inclusiveness. The internet is a powerful tool that
              can be used for good and to spread awareness of global issues, for
              instance, the current war happening between Russia and Ukraine.
              Within minutes of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a large majority of
              the world was already aware of its happening. Due to the influence
              of social media and news networks information spreads extremely
              quickly across the web. This is great for helping to improve
              global connectedness and communication, however, with factors such
              as fake news, the after-effects of colonialism on decolonised
              countries and the world's heavily invested reliance on the
              'internet' there are a few things that must be considered when
              viewing the internet and society. As a developer for these
              platforms, one must always consider what is just in their design
              as well as their design practices.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              We are living in a far more progressive, inclusive and open-minded
              society than ever before. Now more than ever we are seeing
              individuals express themselves as who they wish to be, but in
              order for everyone to feel included, especially on the internet,
              it is important that we design with all individuals in mind.
              Social constructs of gender and identity are slowly dissolving and
              it is important for developers to make sure that no individual,
              regardless of their identity, feels left out or injusticed due to
              some design flaw. For instance Sasha Costanza-Chock describes
              their troubling experiences with airport security in their book
              'TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix
              of Domination' [1]. They describes their experience of passing the
              security gates at an airport, due to particular sociotechnical
              configuration of gender normativity (cis-normativity, or the
              assumption that all people have a gender identity that is
              consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth) that has been
              built into the scanner, The device is designed by social standards
              to identify a person passing it as either male or female by the
              genitalia it detects in the scan. There is no space for anything
              inbetween and so it flagged Sasha, prompting them to a physical
              patdown by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer.
              The next issue faced in this situation was the standard of who
              would now search Sasha, as Sasha identifies as a nonbinary, trans,
              femme-presenting person. The general standard is that individual
              would be searched by officer of the same gender. In Sashas case,
              neither of the TSA agents were of the same gender or indentified
              as the same gender as her and so already Sasha was placed in a
              position of embarrassment and humilition that they should not have
              had to go through if these design features were taken into account
              from the start.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              When it comes to justful and inclusive design, designers must use
              their designs to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as
              well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive
              systems[2]. It is our job as designers to creative inclusive
              communities to make sure that no individual is left out or
              unheard. This can be done through education and communication
              which will always lead to greater awareness and hopefully cause
              developers to think more about how they can design more user
              inclusive and just designs globally. It is important that
              developers understand and have a look at the effects of
              colonisation and more importantly decolonisation when considering
              their designs. Colonisation left many countries in states of
              inequality and poverty and because of this it has taken much
              longer for technology to catch up to them. These factors need to
              be thought of by designers in order for their designs to be
              utilized globally. We must consider the infrastructure and
              technological capabilities that other areas in the world might
              have, especially 3rd world countries. We need to think of ways
              that our designs can be utilized effectively and can help promote
              these 3rd world countries in order to improve their everyday
              standard of living. As Designers it is our responsibility to
              ensure a globally inclusive world, that accepts and includes all
              individuals within it. By doing so we can help improve global
              development, communication, education and improve the standard of
              living for everyone within the world.

            <h2>
              A critical analysis of the internet artwork JODI and its relevance
              in the world of digital art
            </h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              What is art? Art and what exactly it is has always been quite a
              controversial topic in history and contemporary philosophy. Even
              the idea of whether art can be defined is itself a rather
              controversial topic. According to the Oxford Dictionary, art is
              the expression or application of human creative skill and
              imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or
              sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their
              beauty or emotional power [1]. Art was always constrained to the
              mediums of pen, paper and the physical environment and so its
              definitions were formed to those constraints. Today we live in a
              digital world, with digital constraints and because of that I
              believe we need to redefine art, move it away from a standard of
              beauty, authenticity and audience. The constraints of art in a
              digital age are dissolved, the definition is far more fluid and
              needs to be examined in further detail.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The French artist Edgar Degas says “Art is not what you see, but
              what you make others see.” I believe this quote quite accurately
              sums up all great art, or at least the purpose of all great
              artworks, regardless of their medium. Art has the power to
              influence, and with this power it can sometimes affect real
              change. An example of this is Leonardo Da Vinci's studies of the
              foetus in the womb. Da Vinci's discoveries and methods went on to
              change the way that both artists and scientists studied the human
              body [2]. In order to explore this concept of what is art and how
              can art in itself effect change, I would like to explore the works
              of two internet artists who were the leading pioneers of web-based
              art, Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands) and
              Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). The pair created
              an art duo in 1994 called JODI, along with a website in 1995 under
              the same name comprising a collection of their digital art, which
              can be visited through the url
              “http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/”.[3][6][10]
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              JODI is one of the earliest internet artworks ever created, and
              was one of the founders of the medium. The artistic duo produce
              video and new media works that play with the increasing presence
              of technology in our daily lives. According to Artsy.net JODI
              disrupts and disassembles ubiquitous software, video games, and
              popular internet platforms such as Google Maps and Twitter,
              cultivating coding malfunctions and programming glitches [4]. The
              pair got the idea for the website from code modifications and
              glitches that were implemented or found by the pair in old video
              games like Wolfenstein, Quake and Max Payne 2. [3]

              The page is composed of various intricate landscapes made in basic
              HTML. The website shares the appearance of most pre 2000 viruses
              and upon my first visit to the website I believed I myself had
              encountered a computer virus rather than a digital artwork.
              However, that is all this website is, a series of non-functional,
              non-threatening, visually stimulating works of digital art created
              through HTML. The artworks are interactable to some degree, many
              you can scroll through and move around, and there are various
              'click points'/ 'hyperlinks' set up in each artwork that will take
              you to another artwork or page when clicked on. I found the
              artwork to be very appealing visually as it appeals to my taste in
              retro 90's fashion, through its use of the generic RGB (Red,
              Green, Blue) colour scheme, and its 'hacker' style of presentation
              that reminds me of a command terminal.

              JODI was the winner of the 1999 Webby Awards in the category of
              Net Art. A tradition of the Webby awards is that every winner of
              the Webby awards is granted a “5-word acceptance speech” and the
              creators of JODI chose “Ugly Commercial Sons of Bitches”.[3] The
              intention of the JODI artists in this statement were to criticise
              the creators of the Webby awards who, although, promote and help
              advertise the art and net art community, aid in detracting from
              the value of the artwork. The artists said of JODI “We decided to
              put the work immediately on the screen, without our press releases
              and without our bio. We don't use our site to present information.
              We present screens and things that are happening in these screens.
              We avoid explanations. Look at any exhibition: People are sniffing
              on the information plates next to the art works, before they look
              at the work itself. They want to know who did a piece, before they
              have an opinion about it. As long as we can we try to avoid
              that.”[5] The creators of JODI created the work of art with
              intention. There is meaning behind their craft and that is what
              they want to highlight more than anything else. The creators were
              not looking for fame or fortune in their creation, they created it
              as art for the sake of art, to deliver a message. Walter Benjamin
              claims in his book The work of art in the age of mechanical
              reproduction that “works of art are received and valued on
              different planes. Two types stand out; with one, the accent is on
              the cult value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the
              work.”[9] The artwork was not created for exhibition as it had no
              physical medium, it was a one on one experience with the user and
              their computer. The artwork's value was entirely based on its cult
              value. JODI's intention is to expose the backside of the internet,
              the dangers of it, the beauty of it, the way it works and all the
              hidden elements it contains. One can think of the artwork as a
              metaphor of the World Wide Web (WWW). The work highlights that
              code is behind everything on the web.
            </p>

            <p>
              When creating the website the artists made a very simple mistake
              of forgetting a forward slash in the first command. Due to this,
              the drawing on the page was broken, incorrectly spaced and all
              over the place. [6] At first the developers thought there was
              something wrong with their computer but after some trial and error
              decided that the effect was quite interesting and decided to
              publish it online. Due to this, the mistake was reproduced
              endlessly and eventually everyone saw the exact same mistake. By
              daring to make that mistake, they made the code the subject of the
              piece.[5] This drew the audience's attention to the source code of
              that webpage, which when requested to view in one's browser
              reveals the correct version of the drawing. Many users attempted
              to figure out what the code written on the source page is. A user
              from Everything Cyber Wiki analysed the code, a cluster of green
              text, and found it be an ascii encoding of a schematic for a
              Hydrogen (atomic) Bomb.[7] Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk the
              creators of JODI said “That hidden layer was a very interesting
              way to draw attention to the code, which is inevitably behind
              everything.” [8] When clicking on the green text the user is taken
              to a new webpage which is a topographical map that includes
              various names, messages and an IP address with the text “Betalab”
              above. The same user on Everything Cyber Wiki discovered that
              Betalab is a research lab in DC and that this IP address,
              131.24.167, is the IP address for an air force base in Alabama.
              Apparently there is no danger behind this information and that it
              was added to draw controversy to the website.[7]

              In a time before pop-up blockers and anti-virus programs, users
              who visited the website JODI would be spammed with a series of
              pop-up windows that would take a picture of your desktop and
              manipulate into different variants. If the user attempted to stop
              it they would just be redirected to a different variant. The
              software did no real harm to the user's computer and was only
              implemented to frighten the user. Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk
              the creators of JODI said “There was, however, no real
              manipulation of the computer at a deeper level. For us, the
              computer's graphic interface was sufficiently interesting.” “It
              was indeed all in the head of the user, because nothing actually
              went wrong. The work was about the user's relationship with the
              mouse, the keyboard, and the monitor. It included three pieces of
              software, three programs, each externally exploring one of those
              elements.”[8]
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The intentions of the developers of JODI were to explore the
              various sides of the internet through artworks of software, code
              and digital graphics. What I find most interesting about the
              artwork is the variations that stemmed as a result of its
              creation. Many users on the internet saw this website as a
              brilliant opportunity to create replicas that would actually
              infect your computer with viruses. By hiding themselves under the
              ploy of this artwork hundreds of false sights were created under
              similar domains as the original JODI, to the point where even
              today if you only search “joid.org” in your browser you will come
              across a seemingly endless series of websites that all look the
              same but not identical to the original artwork. Most of the time
              you are sent to the original site, and other times you are sent to
              later works of the artists, but it is an endless expanse of
              artwork and glitches for one to explore if they are brave enough.

            <p>
              Walter Benjamin said in his book The work of art in the age of
              mechanical reproduction “In principle, a work of art has always
              been reproducible. Man-made artefacts could always be imitated by
              men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by
              masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties
              in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of art,
              however, represents something new.” JODI is a website that has
              reproduced many replicas and in some ways due to its creation
              created a whole new medium of art, net art. The artists were
              experimenting with the creation of a mass medium “In that sense,
              we are producing a work that pins the honest expression of all
              these people against our ideas about art. It is the age-old story
              of the artist who is jealous of the nonartist, because he or she
              can formulate his or her expressions in a very direct way.”[8]
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Art's value is discerned from its authenticity, replicas hold
              little to no value in the world of art. This is what made the
              world of net art so controversial. One could copy a website or a
              piece of net art to a degree of indiscernible inditcality. The
              only thing that one had power over was a domain and an IP address
              which could link the authenticity of a website, however, this was
              still not entirely safe. Most art holds value in authenticity
              because “this unique existence of the work of art determined the
              history to which it was subject throughout the time of its
              existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in
              physical condition over the years as well as the various changes
              in its ownership.”[9] JODI does not degrade in time nor does it
              suffer damage from the weather and wear. The artwork remains
              intact throughout its entire life and is even editable, meaning it
              can be improved. So where does the value in JODI lie?
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The developers of JODI said “Well, if I look at our work
              retrospectively, the basic idea might be to get a better insight
              into the ways a computer system functions, or rather, how you can
              tell stories through all kinds of symbolic tricks. Through
              manipulation, you can discover how the machine is constructed; how
              it is trying to have you believe that something cannot be done
              differently. We show that it can certainly be done
              differently!”[8] So JODI is an expression of how things can be
              done differently. It is a statement that we can express things in
              any way we choose, the fact that it was an entirely new medium for
              that time is proof of, the creators wanted to do things
              differently.

            <p>
              Walter Benjamin states that “The authenticity of a thing is the
              essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging
              from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history
              which it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on
              the authenticity, the former, too, is jeopardised by reproduction
              when substantive duration ceases to matter. And what is really
              jeopardised when the historical testimony is affected is the
              authority of the object.”[9] so if this authenticity of a thing is
              jeopardised by its historical authenticity how has JODI managed to
              maintain its authenticity? The website has had to switch its
              domain on various occasions, hence the series of www’s in the URL.
              However, it has maintained its authenticity through its
              uniqueness. The fact that it is the original website when you find
              it, gives its value. The fact that so many replicas exist do not
              detract from the value of the original website. The others are all
              works of art in their own right, even if they do have malicious
              intentions.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The value of the website stands on its own, on its domain. This is
              entirely new for the world of art as previous replicas of art held
              little value, however now they stand entirely on their own as
              individual works to be experienced and appreciated. The beauty of
              the artwork is that it is not limited by a physical domain, you
              don't have to go to a museum to see the original, all you need is
              a computer with an internet connection. Walter Benjamin speaks on
              the value of replicas and artworks with regard to their
              authenticity and says that “secondly, technical reproduction can
              put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of
              reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original
              to meet the beholder halfway.”[9] So with JODI there is no need to
              meet halfway, one can experience the original anywhere as long as
              they have the technological means. This introduced an entirely new
              element to the world of art, it brought art to the audience.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              I believe that JODI is a perfect example of art in the digital age
              and sufficiently allows us to explore the medium of art and what
              it is. Art is an experience that the viewer has with a creation.
              The audience experiences its message, its history and its value
              whether that be cultural, historical, political or monetary, all
              art holds value and it is there to be experienced. This is what
              makes art, art.

            <h2>A detailed reflection of the creation of my website</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Fractally is a website that looks at Fractals in all their wonder.
              I have always been interested in fractals and how they are created
              and wanted to learn more about creating them myself. I thought
              this website to be a brilliant opportunity to do just that. So my
              focus for this first iteration of the website “Fractally” was to
              deploy a basic website that had the skeleton for all the features
              I wish to implement on the website in the future. I believe I have
              achieved this goal as all features, pages and tools that I wish to
              use have been created and set up.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              I began creation of the website with a navigation bar that was
              made using React States and by deciding which tabs I wanted to
              display. I created the Navbar and then made the navbar responsive
              for different screen sizes by changing it from a bar at the top of
              the screen to a Side navigation bar that can be toggled on and
              off. I felt this would look very good on mobile devices and would
              help make things look sleaker by removing all the extra text in
              the Navbar at the top of the screen and allowing the user ot
              utilise it only when navigation is needed.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              I linked all the navbar buttons to their respective pages using
              react routing. From here I added the basic design for each page.
              As a feature to test react props, I created a 'Mini Window'
              prop/function that allows me to place an image and some text in a
              nice box that is interactable and can navigate me to different
              parts of my website. I use this Mini Window on my homepage to
              display my Blogs as I felt it was a nice to way to organise them
              and draw the user towards them without the user being scared off
              by walls of text.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              My Blog page contains all my blogs that I have written this year,
              each separated into their own boxes using css. The Fractals page
              only has my wireframes in it as of this moment, However, in the
              feature I wish to make it a page with lots of interesting facts
              and information fractals.{" "}
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Finally my Fractal Viewer page which can be access by 2 buttons,
              the Fractal Viewer button and the Start button on the homepage.
              This is going to be the main feature of my website and the aspect
              that will make it a Net art and not just an ordinary website about
              fractals. I wish to create a program that will generate a
              mandelbrot fractal set that the user can view when in the Fractal
              Viewer page. By doing so I hope to allow my users to see the
              beauty and unimaginable infiniteness of fractals. I have found
              various open source programs that create mandelbrot fractals and
              have been looking at using these in conjunction with myt website
              to create and even more spectacular library of fractals.
            </p>
                <br></br>
            <p>
              The website has all features of its skeleton/framework in place.
              What is left is for me to add a footer to the website with
              information about myself and the website itself. The main focus of
              the next iteration of this website will be on creating the
              mandelbrot fractal viewer.{" "}
            </p>
