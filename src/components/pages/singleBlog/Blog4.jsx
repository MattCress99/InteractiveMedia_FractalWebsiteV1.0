              A critical analysis of the internet artwork JODI and its relevance
              in the world of digital art
            </h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              What is art? Art and what exactly it is has always been quite a
              controversial topic in history and contemporary philosophy. Even
              the idea of whether art can be defined is itself a rather
              controversial topic. According to the Oxford Dictionary, art is
              the expression or application of human creative skill and
              imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or
              sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their
              beauty or emotional power [1]. Art was always constrained to the
              mediums of pen, paper and the physical environment and so its
              definitions were formed to those constraints. Today we live in a
              digital world, with digital constraints and because of that I
              believe we need to redefine art, move it away from a standard of
              beauty, authenticity and audience. The constraints of art in a
              digital age are dissolved, the definition is far more fluid and
              needs to be examined in further detail.

              The French artist Edgar Degas says “Art is not what you see, but
              what you make others see.” I believe this quote quite accurately
              sums up all great art, or at least the purpose of all great
              artworks, regardless of their medium. Art has the power to
              influence, and with this power it can sometimes affect real
              change. An example of this is Leonardo Da Vinci's studies of the
              foetus in the womb. Da Vinci's discoveries and methods went on to
              change the way that both artists and scientists studied the human
              body [2]. In order to explore this concept of what is art and how
              can art in itself effect change, I would like to explore the works
              of two internet artists who were the leading pioneers of web-based
              art, Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands) and
              Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). The pair created
              an art duo in 1994 called JODI, along with a website in 1995 under
              the same name comprising a collection of their digital art, which
              can be visited through the url
              “http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/”.[3][6][10]
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              JODI is one of the earliest internet artworks ever created, and
              was one of the founders of the medium. The artistic duo produce
              video and new media works that play with the increasing presence
              of technology in our daily lives. According to Artsy.net JODI
              disrupts and disassembles ubiquitous software, video games, and
              popular internet platforms such as Google Maps and Twitter,
              cultivating coding malfunctions and programming glitches [4]. The
              pair got the idea for the website from code modifications and
              glitches that were implemented or found by the pair in old video
              games like Wolfenstein, Quake and Max Payne 2. [3]

              The page is composed of various intricate landscapes made in basic
              HTML. The website shares the appearance of most pre 2000 viruses
              and upon my first visit to the website I believed I myself had
              encountered a computer virus rather than a digital artwork.
              However, that is all this website is, a series of non-functional,
              non-threatening, visually stimulating works of digital art created
              through HTML. The artworks are interactable to some degree, many
              you can scroll through and move around, and there are various
              'click points'/ 'hyperlinks' set up in each artwork that will take
              you to another artwork or page when clicked on. I found the
              artwork to be very appealing visually as it appeals to my taste in
              retro 90's fashion, through its use of the generic RGB (Red,
              Green, Blue) colour scheme, and its 'hacker' style of presentation
              that reminds me of a command terminal.

              JODI was the winner of the 1999 Webby Awards in the category of
              Net Art. A tradition of the Webby awards is that every winner of
              the Webby awards is granted a “5-word acceptance speech” and the
              creators of JODI chose “Ugly Commercial Sons of Bitches”.[3] The
              intention of the JODI artists in this statement were to criticise
              the creators of the Webby awards who, although, promote and help
              advertise the art and net art community, aid in detracting from
              the value of the artwork. The artists said of JODI “We decided to
              put the work immediately on the screen, without our press releases
              and without our bio. We don't use our site to present information.
              We present screens and things that are happening in these screens.
              We avoid explanations. Look at any exhibition: People are sniffing
              on the information plates next to the art works, before they look
              at the work itself. They want to know who did a piece, before they
              have an opinion about it. As long as we can we try to avoid
              that.”[5] The creators of JODI created the work of art with
              intention. There is meaning behind their craft and that is what
              they want to highlight more than anything else. The creators were
              not looking for fame or fortune in their creation, they created it
              as art for the sake of art, to deliver a message. Walter Benjamin
              claims in his book The work of art in the age of mechanical
              reproduction that “works of art are received and valued on
              different planes. Two types stand out; with one, the accent is on
              the cult value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the
              work.”[9] The artwork was not created for exhibition as it had no
              physical medium, it was a one on one experience with the user and
              their computer. The artwork's value was entirely based on its cult
              value. JODI's intention is to expose the backside of the internet,
              the dangers of it, the beauty of it, the way it works and all the
              hidden elements it contains. One can think of the artwork as a
              metaphor of the World Wide Web (WWW). The work highlights that
              code is behind everything on the web.
            </p>

            <p>
              When creating the website the artists made a very simple mistake
              of forgetting a forward slash in the first command. Due to this,
              the drawing on the page was broken, incorrectly spaced and all
              over the place. [6] At first the developers thought there was
              something wrong with their computer but after some trial and error
              decided that the effect was quite interesting and decided to
              publish it online. Due to this, the mistake was reproduced
              endlessly and eventually everyone saw the exact same mistake. By
              daring to make that mistake, they made the code the subject of the
              piece.[5] This drew the audience's attention to the source code of
              that webpage, which when requested to view in one's browser
              reveals the correct version of the drawing. Many users attempted
              to figure out what the code written on the source page is. A user
              from Everything Cyber Wiki analysed the code, a cluster of green
              text, and found it be an ascii encoding of a schematic for a
              Hydrogen (atomic) Bomb.[7] Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk the
              creators of JODI said “That hidden layer was a very interesting
              way to draw attention to the code, which is inevitably behind
              everything.” [8] When clicking on the green text the user is taken
              to a new webpage which is a topographical map that includes
              various names, messages and an IP address with the text “Betalab”
              above. The same user on Everything Cyber Wiki discovered that
              Betalab is a research lab in DC and that this IP address,
              131.24.167, is the IP address for an air force base in Alabama.
              Apparently there is no danger behind this information and that it
              was added to draw controversy to the website.[7]

              In a time before pop-up blockers and anti-virus programs, users
              who visited the website JODI would be spammed with a series of
              pop-up windows that would take a picture of your desktop and
              manipulate into different variants. If the user attempted to stop
              it they would just be redirected to a different variant. The
              software did no real harm to the user's computer and was only
              implemented to frighten the user. Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk
              the creators of JODI said “There was, however, no real
              manipulation of the computer at a deeper level. For us, the
              computer's graphic interface was sufficiently interesting.” “It
              was indeed all in the head of the user, because nothing actually
              went wrong. The work was about the user's relationship with the
              mouse, the keyboard, and the monitor. It included three pieces of
              software, three programs, each externally exploring one of those
              elements.”[8]
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The intentions of the developers of JODI were to explore the
              various sides of the internet through artworks of software, code
              and digital graphics. What I find most interesting about the
              artwork is the variations that stemmed as a result of its
              creation. Many users on the internet saw this website as a
              brilliant opportunity to create replicas that would actually
              infect your computer with viruses. By hiding themselves under the
              ploy of this artwork hundreds of false sights were created under
              similar domains as the original JODI, to the point where even
              today if you only search “joid.org” in your browser you will come
              across a seemingly endless series of websites that all look the
              same but not identical to the original artwork. Most of the time
              you are sent to the original site, and other times you are sent to
              later works of the artists, but it is an endless expanse of
              artwork and glitches for one to explore if they are brave enough.

            <p>
              Walter Benjamin said in his book The work of art in the age of
              mechanical reproduction “In principle, a work of art has always
              been reproducible. Man-made artefacts could always be imitated by
              men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by
              masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties
              in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of art,
              however, represents something new.” JODI is a website that has
              reproduced many replicas and in some ways due to its creation
              created a whole new medium of art, net art. The artists were
              experimenting with the creation of a mass medium “In that sense,
              we are producing a work that pins the honest expression of all
              these people against our ideas about art. It is the age-old story
              of the artist who is jealous of the nonartist, because he or she
              can formulate his or her expressions in a very direct way.”[8]
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Art's value is discerned from its authenticity, replicas hold
              little to no value in the world of art. This is what made the
              world of net art so controversial. One could copy a website or a
              piece of net art to a degree of indiscernible inditcality. The
              only thing that one had power over was a domain and an IP address
              which could link the authenticity of a website, however, this was
              still not entirely safe. Most art holds value in authenticity
              because “this unique existence of the work of art determined the
              history to which it was subject throughout the time of its
              existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in
              physical condition over the years as well as the various changes
              in its ownership.”[9] JODI does not degrade in time nor does it
              suffer damage from the weather and wear. The artwork remains
              intact throughout its entire life and is even editable, meaning it
              can be improved. So where does the value in JODI lie?
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The developers of JODI said “Well, if I look at our work
              retrospectively, the basic idea might be to get a better insight
              into the ways a computer system functions, or rather, how you can
              tell stories through all kinds of symbolic tricks. Through
              manipulation, you can discover how the machine is constructed; how
              it is trying to have you believe that something cannot be done
              differently. We show that it can certainly be done
              differently!”[8] So JODI is an expression of how things can be
              done differently. It is a statement that we can express things in
              any way we choose, the fact that it was an entirely new medium for
              that time is proof of, the creators wanted to do things
              differently.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Walter Benjamin states that “The authenticity of a thing is the
              essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging
              from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history
              which it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on
              the authenticity, the former, too, is jeopardised by reproduction
              when substantive duration ceases to matter. And what is really
              jeopardised when the historical testimony is affected is the
              authority of the object.”[9] so if this authenticity of a thing is
              jeopardised by its historical authenticity how has JODI managed to
              maintain its authenticity? The website has had to switch its
              domain on various occasions, hence the series of www’s in the URL.
              However, it has maintained its authenticity through its
              uniqueness. The fact that it is the original website when you find
              it, gives its value. The fact that so many replicas exist do not
              detract from the value of the original website. The others are all
              works of art in their own right, even if they do have malicious
              intentions.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The value of the website stands on its own, on its domain. This is
              entirely new for the world of art as previous replicas of art held
              little value, however now they stand entirely on their own as
              individual works to be experienced and appreciated. The beauty of
              the artwork is that it is not limited by a physical domain, you
              don't have to go to a museum to see the original, all you need is
              a computer with an internet connection. Walter Benjamin speaks on
              the value of replicas and artworks with regard to their
              authenticity and says that “secondly, technical reproduction can
              put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of
              reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original
              to meet the beholder halfway.”[9] So with JODI there is no need to
              meet halfway, one can experience the original anywhere as long as
              they have the technological means. This introduced an entirely new
              element to the world of art, it brought art to the audience.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              I believe that JODI is a perfect example of art in the digital age
              and sufficiently allows us to explore the medium of art and what
              it is. Art is an experience that the viewer has with a creation.
              The audience experiences its message, its history and its value
              whether that be cultural, historical, political or monetary, all
              art holds value and it is there to be experienced. This is what
              makes art, art.
