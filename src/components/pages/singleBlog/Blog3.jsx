              Many individuals in today's society view the internet as a source
              of change and growth. It is a place where new ideas can grow and
              political and social movements can gain growth and followers. New
              philosophies can be published, criticised and viewed throughout
              the world. The internet has helped us all as a society to grow, it
              has created worldwide awareness on subjects such as identity,
              equality and inclusiveness. The internet is a powerful tool that
              can be used for good and to spread awareness of global issues, for
              instance, the current war happening between Russia and Ukraine.
              Within minutes of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a large majority of
              the world was already aware of its happening. Due to the influence
              of social media and news networks information spreads extremely
              quickly across the web. This is great for helping to improve
              global connectedness and communication, however, with factors such
              as fake news, the after-effects of colonialism on decolonised
              countries and the world's heavily invested reliance on the
              'internet' there are a few things that must be considered when
              viewing the internet and society. As a developer for these
              platforms, one must always consider what is just in their design
              as well as their design practices.

              We are living in a far more progressive, inclusive and open-minded
              society than ever before. Now more than ever we are seeing
              individuals express themselves as who they wish to be, but in
              order for everyone to feel included, especially on the internet,
              it is important that we design with all individuals in mind.
              Social constructs of gender and identity are slowly dissolving and
              it is important for developers to make sure that no individual,
              regardless of their identity, feels left out or injusticed due to
              some design flaw. For instance Sasha Costanza-Chock describes
              their troubling experiences with airport security in their book
              'TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix
              of Domination' [1]. They describes their experience of passing the
              security gates at an airport, due to particular sociotechnical
              configuration of gender normativity (cis-normativity, or the
              assumption that all people have a gender identity that is
              consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth) that has been
              built into the scanner, The device is designed by social standards
              to identify a person passing it as either male or female by the
              genitalia it detects in the scan. There is no space for anything
              inbetween and so it flagged Sasha, prompting them to a physical
              patdown by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer.
              The next issue faced in this situation was the standard of who
              would now search Sasha, as Sasha identifies as a nonbinary, trans,
              femme-presenting person. The general standard is that individual
              would be searched by officer of the same gender. In Sashas case,
              neither of the TSA agents were of the same gender or indentified
              as the same gender as her and so already Sasha was placed in a
              position of embarrassment and humilition that they should not have
              had to go through if these design features were taken into account
              from the start.

              When it comes to justful and inclusive design, designers must use
              their designs to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as
              well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive
              systems[2]. It is our job as designers to creative inclusive
              communities to make sure that no individual is left out or
              unheard. This can be done through education and communication
              which will always lead to greater awareness and hopefully cause
              developers to think more about how they can design more user
              inclusive and just designs globally. It is important that
              developers understand and have a look at the effects of
              colonisation and more importantly decolonisation when considering
              their designs. Colonisation left many countries in states of
              inequality and poverty and because of this it has taken much
              longer for technology to catch up to them. These factors need to
              be thought of by designers in order for their designs to be
              utilized globally. We must consider the infrastructure and
              technological capabilities that other areas in the world might
              have, especially 3rd world countries. We need to think of ways
              that our designs can be utilized effectively and can help promote
              these 3rd world countries in order to improve their everyday
              standard of living. As Designers it is our responsibility to
              ensure a globally inclusive world, that accepts and includes all
              individuals within it. By doing so we can help improve global
              development, communication, education and improve the standard of
              living for everyone within the world.
