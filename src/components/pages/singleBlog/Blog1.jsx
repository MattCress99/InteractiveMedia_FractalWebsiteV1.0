              A critical analysis of Faith, a kinetic poem written by Robert

              The "Electronic Literature Collection” is a library of internet
              artworks. The artworks compose of various images, videos and
              pieces of literature that all utilize their digital format to
              create a unique experience for the audience. The website has an
              old school retro style layout with various web artworks arranged
              in a grid. The website is subtle and looks like it was designed in
              1997 using HTML 2.0 and Adobe Photoshop and never changed since. I
              like this as it gives the website the feel of being a true
              internet archive, and it reminds me of the original 4chan website
              design in many ways. After browsing the collection of artworks, I
              came across an image of old english calligraphy that was quite
              hard to read.I was drawn to the image because the calligraphy
              reminded me of my high school's church, which had similar
              calligraphy on the windows. Upon seeing that the words written in
              calligraphy on the image said “Faith” I knew this was the piece of
              web art I'd been looking for. Clicking on the image takes you to a
              new page where it gives you information about the artwork and an
              option to play the piece. “Faith” is a web art work described by
              the author, Robert Kendall, as a kinetic poem. I found this to be
              very intriguing. In High School, I was a member of the Anglican
              Church of Benoni and practiced as a Lay Minister at my High School
              church. Every morning I would read a prayer for the school during
              morning assemblies and on every Friday I would give a devotion to
              the school during our weekly Eucharist. I believe strongly that
              religion is dominated by practice rather than faith and that faith
              is not spoken about enough. Due to this the majority of my
              devotionals were focused around having Faith and trusting in the
              Lord and that you can find true strength in all religions through
              faith rather than by practice. In my after school hours I was a
              member of and in matric became the head of our schools creative
              writers guild. I particularly enjoy writing poetry during this
              time and have always found it to be my go to method of writing. I
              really enjoy the rhythm in it and because they are often short
              pieces I can put intention and meaning into it. This is why I knew
              that this artwork was the perfect choice.

              Upon clicking “Begin” to play the artwork a window pops up that
              asks whether you would like to play the artwork with or without
              sound. I chose to play with sound in order to capture the full
              intentions of the author, its poetry after all, everything that is
              there is there for a reason. The artwork starts with the word
              'Faith' written in calligraphy at the top of the screen. The words
              'can't', 'logic', 'bend', 'this' float onto the screen and the
              scene ends with the words 'so…' appearing at the bottom of the
              screen which moves you to the next scene if clicked.. Everytime a
              word of the poem moves a sound is played, making the words of the
              poem the notes of this poem's song. So this is both a song as well
              as a poem. I found the words on screen very interesting, “Faith
              can't logic bend this”. In almost all cases of lost faith, it is
              logic that breaks a person's faith. These words remind me of a
              conversation I had with an old hippy looking man who was selling
              tie dye at a psytrance festival back in 2020. I was browsing
              through his clothing and started to have a conversation with him.
              I ended up talking to him for around an hour and we discussed
              various different things, but of all the things we spoke about the
              one thing that stood out was faith. He told me that humans are,
              through society, taught not to have faith. One of the first idols
              or omnipotent beings we are taught to believe in is Santa Claus.
              Everyone knows who Father Christmas is, and at some stage most of
              us believed faithfully that Santa Claus was real. But eventually
              we all have this faith ripped from underneath us, and we learn
              that our parents are actually Santa. This is the first time in
              your life that you are taught to place your faith into something
              false. This is why it is so hard to be faithful, once your trust
              has been broken once it is very hard to regain, as it is with
              Faith. Befitting that the author's first words are a question of
              whether logic can bend faith.{" "}

              Upon clicking to the next scene the other words from the poem
              begin to display themselves on screen. Now we see the 2nd version
              of this poem. Here the author asks the question, can't the mind
              push past logic to maintain faith? To move to the next scene, you
              click the words “Maybe, But…” which then reveals the rest of the
              poem. The poem speaks about the author's faith, and his struggles
              keeping it in today's logic driven society. But in the end he
              comes to the conclusion that it is one's own choice to have faith
              and that we must choose to make that leap of faith in order to
              achieve it, regardless of its consequences. With the poem ending
              in one word “Leap”. Text appears at the bottom saying “Now … ”,
              implying the question; what will happen now that you have faith?
              Clicking this causes all the words including faith to fall to the
              bottom of the screen, with four words “Just to sum up:” left
              standing. Here the author is telling us that in the end faith will
              fall. But the words that fall dont disappear, they remain there,
              just fallen. And this is how faith is, it will always be there.
              However, it is up to us to decide where our faith stands.

              Overall I found this artwork to be extremely relatable and thought
              provoking. The author utilized the fact that this was a digital
              artwork to display his message. Through rearranging text from the
              poem and showing parts of the poem in sections the Author has
              utilized their digital platform far better than if it were written
              stanza for stanza on page. I felt that by making the poem a
              changing and interactable piece it created a unique experience for
              the viewer, one you could only get digitally or online and that it
              helped to deliver the author's message far more clearly and
              precisely. In an article written by David Carrier in 2020, he
              speaks about the value of digital art and the power the platform
              has to create a unique and valuable experience. He says “ What has
              changed is not just the display system, but the very nature of the
              artwork. Now it is not the unique artifact, but the reproductions
              that matter the most to the greatest number of viewers.” and this
              is true of “Faith”. The artwork has huge reproductive value due to
              the fact that anyone can view it without having to own the
              original copy. The artwork is created for the experience, it
              doesn't matter where the artwork is viewed from, every viewer will
              have their own unique and intended experience of the digital
              artwork.
