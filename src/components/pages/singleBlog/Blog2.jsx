            <h2>Core principles for design and aesthetics for the web</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              I was recently enlightened to the idea that a website is far more
              than just a plain old website. Websites at the core are
              collections of code compiled to create an interactable or visual
              user experience. According to 'Techopedia' a website “is a
              collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that
              share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained
              by an individual, group, business or organisation to serve a
              variety of purposes. Together, all publicly accessible websites
              constitute the World Wide Web.”
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              So you might be wondering what I mean by a website is far more
              than just a plain old website. Well, websites have the ability to
              create a significant societal impact. They are a platform for free
              speech and a domain to spread one's ideas, works and creations. It
              is a canvas for everyone. With the web being so easily accessible
              as well as the knowledge needed to create on the web, we are
              seeing more and more websites being created on a daily basis.
              Google alone has over 50 billion indexed webpages. (Please note
              there is a distinct difference between websites and webpages,
              websites are composed of individual webpages that link together to
              create the website.)

            <p>
              So with all these new website designers or Net-artists arising it
              is important to take note of what good web design is and what the
              core principles of design and aesthetics for the web are. I came
              across an article written by Ji Yong Park that was published in
              the 'Journal of Digital Design'. The article was called 'Design
              principles for interactive user experience through net art' and
              the paper talks about how net artists can use core design
              principles to construct a more user-centred design for the net
              art. Parks says that “Net art enables the designers to bridge the
              gap between traditional graphic design and interactive user
              experience in that it has empowered the users to be an interactive
              artist.” [1] The advantage of working on a web based platform to
              create art is that artists can make their work interactable
              through a digital environment. By creating an interactive user
              experience, net artists can create a far more impactful piece of
              work that the user can relate to and feel involved in.

            <br></br>
            <p>
              In reading this article I came across a fascinating website called
              'wwwwwwwww.Jodi.org'. The JODI site was created in 1994 by two net
              artists Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands)
              and Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). Bookchin and
              Shulgin (1999) describe that net art is 'a self-defining term
              created by a malfunctioning piece of software, originally used to
              describe an art and communications activity on the Internet.' [1]
              I feel that the JODI website is a perfect example of this. The
              website is composed of various fragments of html code that looks
              like a computer virus that would be depicted in a 90s hacker
              movie. The site is composed of various webpages of internet art
              that the user can interact with. The site itself doesn't seem to
              have much functionality besides taking the user through the
              various webpages of net art. Everything on the site appears to be
              some form of malfunctioning code or software, however it was
              intended to look that way by the creators. It is a perfect example
              of net art as it is online based, highly experimental and at the
              time it was created, unique. Net artists 'sought to break down
              autonomous disciplines and outmoded classifications imposed upon
              various activists practices.' The essence of net art is that it is
              highly experimental and pushes the boundaries of communication,
              cultural criticism and technology (Greene 2004) - [4]. The net
              itself is becoming more than just a browser, they declare that the
              Net is a temporary autonomous zone that supports anarchy and
              spontaneity in cyberspace. It has become a platform of untapped
              and uncontrolled creativity, a platform for free speech and
              unlimited design.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              What makes Net art so powerful is that the Internet user is not
              merely a viewer or guest but is actively involved in, and
              contributes to the net art experience - a unique situation, not
              often present in other media, and one that decentralises and
              breaks down hierarchies of authorship (Greene 2004) [4]. Net art
              challenges preconceived notions of what the web is, how it works
              and how users participate and experience life online. 4 key
              factors that designers must take into consideration when designing
              for the online environment are: Invisible design elements,
              collaborative participation, anarchic structure and non-linear
              communication.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              From the Form Art perspectives, web interface design should
              consider invisible or hidden design elements in terms of forming a
              user experience. Net artists do not define their works as artworks
              displayed on the screen or in the browser but use the technology
              inherent on the Internet as intrinsic elements of the art they
              produce. The beauty of Net art is that it does not construct those
              boundaries between the artists and the user. This is what makes
              Net art a truly interactive communication method where the user
              can participate in any points of the work process so that the user
              can be the artist and vice versa. The boundary between artist and
              audience is blurred when it comes to Net art and some even argue
              that there is no boundary, artist and audience are one and the
              same thing due to the interactive user experience that creates the
              artwork as well as the beauty in it. Artists and audiences become
              equal subjects as partners or coordinators in net art, thus the
              key issue in net art is not distribution and circulation, but
              communication. Communication is the key feature in net art that
              helps us to define and distinguish the boundaries between net
              artist and audience. Net art has no beginning or end, it is
              present continuously. Time based linear story obstructs user
              participation into net art, and this strictly lets users stay as
              the audience.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Net art is a radical form of activism and creativity that
              functions on a perfect platform for communication, design and free
              speech. The JODI site demonstrates that 'net art has become the
              latest stage for artists to construct experimental forms and
              narratives, challenge convention, initiate dialogs, introduce new
              stages, and threaten old paradigms' (Packer 1998). [2] With JODI
              being created in 1994 as one of the first widely recognised and
              praised net artworks, it shows that the platform has so much
              potential for greatness and is one that will continue to impact
              and advance social creativity in our life and the future of many
              others. Below I have attached links for 3 websites that I believe
              are excellent examples of Net art, I highly recommend going and
              checking them out, you wont regret it!
              <br></br>
              https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/style/leonardo500/ CNN has a
              look at the life of Leonardo Da Vinci and creates a web art
              experience through a visual representation of all his works
              alongside information about him.
