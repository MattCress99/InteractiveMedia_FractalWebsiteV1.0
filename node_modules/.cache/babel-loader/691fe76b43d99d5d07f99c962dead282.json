In this equation, c and i are complex or imaginary numbers and n is\r\n        zero or any positive integer (i.e. natural number). What this equation\r\n        basically means is that the next i value in the set is equal to its\r\n        previous i value square plus some complex number, c. The equation is\r\n        built upon sets of itself essentially. The equation was discovered by\r\n        Benoît Mandelbrot in 1979 [2]. Using IBM’s computers, he was able to use\r\n        computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, this\r\n        allowed him to show how visual complexity can be created from simple\r\n        rules.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I have found fractals to be one of the most beautiful and complex things I\r\n        have ever seen. Therefore, the net art I have chosen to create is a\r\n        website that allows one to view a Mandelbrot fractal. The purpose of the\r\n        website is to give a good understanding of what fractals are and then to\r\n        allow one to view a fractal in detail. I have researched various fractal\r\n        generators online, most cost money and are quite complex to use. They\r\n        work off of applications that run the software as an application on your\r\n        computer. These include websites like Mandelbulb 3D, Apophysis and\r\n        XenoDream [3][4][5]. However, I was able to find some websites that\r\n        allowed you to generate and view fractals. The first was <a href=\"https://sciencevsmagic.net/fractal/#0060,0090,1,1,0,0,1\" target=\"_blank\">Science vs.\r\n        Magic</a>[6], and is a fantastic website that teaches you how fractals are\r\n        built from recursion and iterative feedback loops. The website uses line\r\n        algorithms and builds upon them to create very intricate and beautiful\r\n        equations. The <a href=\"http://usefuljs.net/fractals/\" target=\"_blank\">UsefulJs’ online fractal generator</a> [7] website is another\r\n        very good website that allows one to view various fractal sets such as\r\n        the mandelbrot set in great detail and it also allows you to alter the\r\n        equation used to produce the set, in order to produce new sets.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>\r\n        With my website I will look for an external Javascript plugin that will\r\n        allow me to generate a Mandelbrot fractal set that the viewer of the\r\n        webpage can explore in great detail. I will use a fractal generator to\r\n        produce and extremely high resolution fractal image that the user can\r\n        zoom into in order to see how a fractal is built upon infinite parts of\r\n        itself. I feel the best way to understand exactly what a fractal is, is\r\n        to see it and explore its parts. I personally love to watch videos of\r\n        fractal sets rendered by super computers. They are beautiful and the way\r\n        they continue to create themselves endlessly is super entertaining to\r\n        watch and quite relaxing. I feel I may occur some technical concerns\r\n        here when it comes to implementing the fractal generator on the website\r\n        as the code is complex and will be tricky to understand and utilize for\r\n        my own purposes. However, I will do further research into external\r\n        fractal plugins for javascript and react.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I hope that by creating this website, I will be able to explore fractals\r\n        further and gain a deeper grasp and understanding of what they are, how\r\n        they are created and there purposes in all areas of life. I hope to\r\n        share the love I have for fractals through my website and hopefully\r\n        create that love in you too.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <h3>References:</h3>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>\r\n        [1] Fractalfoundation.org. n.d.

I am in the\r\n        prototyping phase of development. For this release of the prototype I\r\n        have been working on implementing a fractal generator plugin that will\r\n        allow the viewer to view a detailed Mandelbrot set. The plugin uses an\r\n        open source GNU general public license javascript application that\r\n        generates the MandelBrot fractal through an algorithm created by Raphael\r\n        Pedicini. The code is split into two independent parts: app.js and\r\n        fractal.js. The app handles all the setup and user interaction, and\r\n        communicates these to the fractal using the fractal's api. The fractal\r\n        just calculates and draws itself based on the settings it receives from\r\n        the app. I have been working on implementing the code into my website,\r\n        however it is extremely complex and has taken quite some time to get my\r\n        head around. Therefore, I have decided that for this prototype I will\r\n        not include the fractal generator and will instead include it in the\r\n        final release of the website. I feel this is necessary as the website\r\n        still needs work in places elsewhere and as I will need more time to get\r\n        the fractal generator working, I feel it would be best to work on these\r\n        areas of improvement so that the website is almost entirely complete\r\n        without the fractal generator. This will allow me to focus my efforts on\r\n        getting the fractal generator working for the final release and allow me\r\n        to complete the rest of the website in the meantime.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>\r\n        For this release there are a few bugs that I need to fix. The first is\r\n        my images which are too large and dont link correctly in certain areas.\r\n        I would like to add an individual viewing window for each of my blogs so\r\n        one does not have to scroll so much, and possibly add a back to the top\r\n        button on my blog page. I will implement a footer to the website with\r\n        copyright information and my personal information for contact purposes.\r\n        I will fill the site will all the necessary information to make it feel\r\n        more populated and complete. I have designed the website to have feels\r\n        of both early html mathematics websites, through the simple text styles\r\n        and isolated areas of text and image, and modern ‘ios’ like applications\r\n        through the navbar design and simple but clean User Interface.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>\r\n        As of this moment the website does not particularly stand as an\r\n        interactable artwork, although it may be very visually stimulating and\r\n        appealing making it appear ‘artsy’, it is still not yet fully\r\n        interactable as the main point of the website, the fractal generator,\r\n        will not be available yet. However, I do believe as it is now the\r\n        website provides a beautiful insight into the art of fractals and\r\n        displays their beauty in very efficient and simple manner. For the final\r\n        release of the website, the fractal generator will be working and then I\r\n        believe the website can be termed a brilliant example of an internet\r\n        artwork.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <p>By: Matthew Cresswell</p>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
