The artworks compose of various images, videos and pieces of literature that all utilize their digital format to create a unique experience for the audience. The website has an old school retro style layout with various web artworks arranged in a grid. The website is subtle and looks like it was designed in 1997 using HTML 2.0 and Adobe Photoshop and never changed since. I like this as it gives the website the feel of being a true internet archive, and it reminds me of the original 4chan website design in many ways. After browsing the collection of artworks, I came across an image of old english calligraphy that was quite hard to read.I was drawn to the image because the calligraphy reminded me of my high school's church, which had similar calligraphy on the windows. Upon seeing that the words written in calligraphy on the image said \\u201CFaith\\u201D I knew this was the piece of web art I'd been looking for. Clicking on the image takes you to a new page where it gives you information about the artwork and an option to play the piece. \\u201CFaith\\u201D is a web art work described by the author, Robert Kendall, as a kinetic poem. I found this to be very intriguing. In High School, I was a member of the Anglican Church of Benoni and practiced as a Lay Minister at my High School church. Every morning I would read a prayer for the school during morning assemblies and on every Friday I would give a devotion to the school during our weekly Eucharist. I believe strongly that religion is dominated by practice rather than faith and that faith is not spoken about enough. Due to this the majority of my devotionals were focused around having Faith and trusting in the Lord and that you can find true strength in all religions through faith rather than by practice. In my after school hours I was a member of and in matric became the head of our schools creative writers guild. I particularly enjoy writing poetry during this time and have always found it to be my go to method of writing. I really enjoy the rhythm in it and because they are often short pieces I can put intention and meaning into it.

These words remind me of a conversation I had with an old hippy looking man who was selling tie dye at a psytrance festival back in 2020. I was browsing through his clothing and started to have a conversation with him. I ended up talking to him for around an hour and we discussed various different things, but of all the things we spoke about the one thing that stood out was faith. He told me that humans are, through society, taught not to have faith. One of the first idols or omnipotent beings we are taught to believe in is Santa Claus. Everyone knows who Father Christmas is, and at some stage most of us believed faithfully that Santa Claus was real. But eventually we all have this faith ripped from underneath us, and we learn that our parents are actually Santa. This is the first time in your life that you are taught to place your faith into something false. This is why it is so hard to be faithful, once your trust has been broken once it is very hard to regain, as it is with Faith.

This is what makes Net art a truly interactive communication method where the user can participate in any points of the work process so that the user can be the artist and vice versa. The boundary between artist and audience is blurred when it comes to Net art and some even argue that there is no boundary, artist and audience are one and the same thing due to the interactive user experience that creates the artwork as well as the beauty in it. Artists and audiences become equal subjects as partners or coordinators in net art, thus the key issue in net art is not distribution and circulation, but communication.

Social constructs of gender and identity are slowly dissolving and it is important for developers to make sure that no individual, regardless of their identity, feels left out or injusticed due to some design flaw. For instance Sasha Costanza-Chock describes their troubling experiences with airport security in their book 'TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix of Domination' [1]. They describes their experience of passing the security gates at an airport, due to particular sociotechnical configuration of gender normativity (cis-normativity, or the assumption that all people have a gender identity that is consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth) that has been built into the scanner, The device is designed by social standards to identify a person passing it as either male or female by the genitalia it detects in the scan. There is no space for anything inbetween and so it flagged Sasha, prompting them to a physical patdown by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer. The next issue faced in this situation was the standard of who would now search Sasha, as Sasha identifies as a nonbinary, trans, femme-presenting person. The general standard is that individual would be searched by officer of the same gender. In Sashas case, neither of the TSA agents were of the same gender or indentified as the same gender as her and so already Sasha was placed in a position of embarrassment and humilition that they should not have had to go through if these design features were taken into account from the start.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 355,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"br\", {}, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 387,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n            children: \"When it comes to justful and inclusive design, designers must use their designs to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems[2].

This can be done through education and communication which will always lead to greater awareness and hopefully cause developers to think more about how they can design more user inclusive and just designs globally. It is important that developers understand and have a look at the effects of colonisation and more importantly decolonisation when considering their designs. Colonisation left many countries in states of inequality and poverty and because of this it has taken much longer for technology to catch up to them. These factors need to be thought of by designers in order for their designs to be utilized globally.

We need to think of ways that our designs can be utilized effectively and can help promote these 3rd world countries in order to improve their everyday standard of living.

Art was always constrained to the mediums of pen, paper and the physical environment and so its definitions were formed to those constraints. Today we live in a digital world, with digital constraints and because of that I believe we need to redefine art, move it away from a standard of beauty, authenticity and audience.

The artwork's name is \\u201CSpiralling Energy\\u201D and it was created in 2014. The bowl is woven from agave sisalana (sisal) and lutindzi grass, both common plants found in Southern Africa. The bowl has a beautiful black archimedean spiral across its surface. No other patterns or geometrics are present on the bowl besides the spiral. The bowl is a beautiful construct composed entirely of archimedean spirals [5]. The actual material of the bowel is laced together in an archimedean spiral, with the bowl being created from the inner point and expanding outwards. The spiral on the bowl is entirely fractal in nature as its shape is that of a point moving on a line that is rotated uniformly about the origin (an Archemedian spiral) and the spiral is composed of a sequence of lines that iteratively increase in width as it expands outwards from the centre of the bowl. I believe that this bowl is a perfect example of fractal design in African culture and is so relevant to the subject that one could even consider it a caricature of fractal design in African art.

I am in the prototyping phase of development. For this release of the prototype I have been working on implementing a fractal generator plugin that will allow the viewer to view a detailed Mandelbrot set. The plugin uses an open source GNU general public license javascript application that generates the MandelBrot fractal through an algorithm created by Raphael Pedicini. The code is split into two independent parts: app.js and fractal.js. The app handles all the setup and user interaction, and communicates these to the fractal using the fractal's api. The fractal just calculates and draws itself based on the settings it receives from the app. I have been working on implementing the code into my website, however it is extremely complex and has taken quite some time to get my head around. Therefore, I have decided that for this prototype I will not include the fractal generator and will instead include it in the final release of the website. I feel this is necessary as the website still needs work in places elsewhere and as I will need more time to get the fractal generator working, I feel it would be best to work on these areas of improvement so that the website is almost entirely complete without the fractal generator.

kinetic poem written by Robert\r\n              Kendal\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The \"Electronic Literature Collection” is a library of internet\r\n              artworks. The artworks compose of various images, videos and\r\n              pieces of literature that all utilize their digital format to\r\n              create a unique experience for the audience. The website has an\r\n              old school retro style layout with various web artworks arranged\r\n              in a grid. The website is subtle and looks like it was designed in\r\n              1997 using HTML 2.0 and Adobe Photoshop and never changed since. I\r\n              like this as it gives the website the feel of being a true\r\n              internet archive, and it reminds me of the original 4chan website\r\n              design in many ways. After browsing the collection of artworks, I\r\n              came across an image of old english calligraphy that was quite\r\n              hard to read.I was drawn to the image because the calligraphy\r\n              reminded me of my high school's church, which had similar\r\n              calligraphy on the windows. Upon seeing that the words written in\r\n              calligraphy on the image said “Faith” I knew this was the piece of\r\n              web art I'd been looking for. Clicking on the image takes you to a\r\n              new page where it gives you information about the artwork and an\r\n              option to play the piece. “Faith” is a web art work described by\r\n              the author, Robert Kendall, as a kinetic poem. I found this to be\r\n              very intriguing. In High School, I was a member of the Anglican\r\n              Church of Benoni and practiced as a Lay Minister at my High School\r\n              church. Every morning I would read a prayer for the school during\r\n              morning assemblies and on every Friday I would give a devotion to\r\n              the school during our weekly Eucharist. I believe strongly that\r\n              religion is dominated by practice rather than faith and that faith\r\n              is not spoken about enough. Due to this the majority of my\r\n              devotionals were focused around having Faith and trusting in the\r\n              Lord and that you can find true strength in all religions through\r\n              faith rather than by practice. In my after school hours I was a\r\n              member of and in matric became the head of our schools creative\r\n              writers guild. I particularly enjoy writing poetry during this\r\n              time and have always found it to be my go to method of writing. I\r\n              really enjoy the rhythm in it and because they are often short\r\n              pieces I can put intention and meaning into it. This is why I knew\r\n              that this artwork was the perfect choice.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Upon clicking “Begin” to play the artwork a window pops up that\r\n              asks whether you would like to play the artwork with or without\r\n              sound. I chose to play with sound in order to capture the full\r\n              intentions of the author, its poetry after all, everything that is\r\n              there is there for a reason. The artwork starts with the word\r\n              'Faith' written in calligraphy at the top of the screen. The words\r\n              'can't', 'logic', 'bend', 'this' float onto the screen and the\r\n              scene ends with the words 'so…' appearing at the bottom of the\r\n              screen which moves you to the next scene if clicked.. Everytime a\r\n              word of the poem moves a sound is played, making the words of the\r\n              poem the notes of this poem's song. So this is both a song as well\r\n              as a poem. I found the words on screen very interesting, “Faith\r\n              can't logic bend this”. In almost all cases of lost faith, it is\r\n              logic that breaks a person's faith. These words remind me of a\r\n              conversation I had with an old hippy looking man who was selling\r\n              tie dye at a psytrance festival back in 2020. I was browsing\r\n              through his clothing and started to have a conversation with him.\r\n              I ended up talking to him for around an hour and we discussed\r\n              various different things, but of all the things we spoke about the\r\n              one thing that stood out was faith. He told me that humans are,\r\n              through society, taught not to have faith. One of the first idols\r\n              or omnipotent beings we are taught to believe in is Santa Claus.\r\n              Everyone knows who Father Christmas is, and at some stage most of\r\n              us believed faithfully that Santa Claus was real. But eventually\r\n              we all have this faith ripped from underneath us, and we learn\r\n              that our parents are actually Santa. This is the first time in\r\n              your life that you are taught to place your faith into something\r\n              false. This is why it is so hard to be faithful, once your trust\r\n              has been broken once it is very hard to regain, as it is with\r\n              Faith. Befitting that the author's first words are a question of\r\n              whether logic can bend faith.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Upon clicking to the next scene the other words from the poem\r\n              begin to display themselves on screen. Now we see the 2nd version\r\n              of this poem. Here the author asks the question, can't the mind\r\n              push past logic to maintain faith? To move to the next scene, you\r\n              click the words “Maybe, But…” which then reveals the rest of the\r\n              poem. The poem speaks about the author's faith, and his struggles\r\n              keeping it in today's logic driven society. But in the end he\r\n              comes to the conclusion that it is one's own choice to have faith\r\n              and that we must choose to make that leap of faith in order to\r\n              achieve it, regardless of its consequences. With the poem ending\r\n              in one word “Leap”. Text appears at the bottom saying “Now … ”,\r\n              implying the question; what will happen now that you have faith?\r\n              Clicking this causes all the words including faith to fall to the\r\n              bottom of the screen, with four words “Just to sum up:” left\r\n              standing. Here the author is telling us that in the end faith will\r\n              fall. But the words that fall dont disappear, they remain there,\r\n              just fallen. And this is how faith is, it will always be there.\r\n              However, it is up to us to decide where our faith stands.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Overall I found this artwork to be extremely relatable and thought\r\n              provoking. The author utilized the fact that this was a digital\r\n              artwork to display his message. Through rearranging text from the\r\n              poem and showing parts of the poem in sections the Author has\r\n              utilized their digital platform far better than if it were written\r\n              stanza for stanza on page. I felt that by making the poem a\r\n              changing and interactable piece it created a unique experience for\r\n              the viewer, one you could only get digitally or online and that it\r\n              helped to deliver the author's message far more clearly and\r\n              precisely. In an article written by David Carrier in 2020, he\r\n              speaks about the value of digital art and the power the platform\r\n              has to create a unique and valuable experience. He says “ What has\r\n              changed is not just the display system, but the very nature of the\r\n              artwork. Now it is not the unique artifact, but the reproductions\r\n              that matter the most to the greatest number of viewers.” and this\r\n              is true of “Faith”. The artwork has huge reproductive value due to\r\n              the fact that anyone can view it without having to own the\r\n              original copy. The artwork is created for the experience, it\r\n              doesn't matter where the artwork is viewed from, every viewer will\r\n              have their own unique and intended experience of the digital\r\n              artwork.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>by: Matthew Cresswell</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              [1] CARRIER, D.

Websites at the core are\r\n              collections of code compiled to create an interactable or visual\r\n              user experience. According to 'Techopedia' a website “is a\r\n              collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that\r\n              share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained\r\n              by an individual, group, business or organisation to serve a\r\n              variety of purposes. Together, all publicly accessible websites\r\n              constitute the World Wide Web.”\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              So you might be wondering what I mean by a website is far more\r\n              than just a plain old website. Well, websites have the ability to\r\n              create a significant societal impact. They are a platform for free\r\n              speech and a domain to spread one's ideas, works and creations. It\r\n              is a canvas for everyone. With the web being so easily accessible\r\n              as well as the knowledge needed to create on the web, we are\r\n              seeing more and more websites being created on a daily basis.\r\n              Google alone has over 50 billion indexed webpages. (Please note\r\n              there is a distinct difference between websites and webpages,\r\n              websites are composed of individual webpages that link together to\r\n              create the website.)\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              So with all these new website designers or Net-artists arising it\r\n              is important to take note of what good web design is and what the\r\n              core principles of design and aesthetics for the web are. I came\r\n              across an article written by Ji Yong Park that was published in\r\n              the 'Journal of Digital Design'. The article was called 'Design\r\n              principles for interactive user experience through net art' and\r\n              the paper talks about how net artists can use core design\r\n              principles to construct a more user-centred design for the net\r\n              art. Parks says that “Net art enables the designers to bridge the\r\n              gap between traditional graphic design and interactive user\r\n              experience in that it has empowered the users to be an interactive\r\n              artist.” [1] The advantage of working on a web based platform to\r\n              create art is that artists can make their work interactable\r\n              through a digital environment. By creating an interactive user\r\n              experience, net artists can create a far more impactful piece of\r\n              work that the user can relate to and feel involved in.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In reading this article I came across a fascinating website called\r\n              'wwwwwwwww.Jodi.org'. The JODI site was created in 1994 by two net\r\n              artists Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands)\r\n              and Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). Bookchin and\r\n              Shulgin (1999) describe that net art is 'a self-defining term\r\n              created by a malfunctioning piece of software, originally used to\r\n              describe an art and communications activity on the Internet.' [1]\r\n              I feel that the JODI website is a perfect example of this. The\r\n              website is composed of various fragments of html code that looks\r\n              like a computer virus that would be depicted in a 90s hacker\r\n              movie. The site is composed of various webpages of internet art\r\n              that the user can interact with. The site itself doesn't seem to\r\n              have much functionality besides taking the user through the\r\n              various webpages of net art. Everything on the site appears to be\r\n              some form of malfunctioning code or software, however it was\r\n              intended to look that way by the creators. It is a perfect example\r\n              of net art as it is online based, highly experimental and at the\r\n              time it was created, unique. Net artists 'sought to break down\r\n              autonomous disciplines and outmoded classifications imposed upon\r\n              various activists practices.' The essence of net art is that it is\r\n              highly experimental and pushes the boundaries of communication,\r\n              cultural criticism and technology (Greene 2004) - [4]. The net\r\n              itself is becoming more than just a browser, they declare that the\r\n              Net is a temporary autonomous zone that supports anarchy and\r\n              spontaneity in cyberspace. It has become a platform of untapped\r\n              and uncontrolled creativity, a platform for free speech and\r\n              unlimited design.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              What makes Net art so powerful is that the Internet user is not\r\n              merely a viewer or guest but is actively involved in, and\r\n              contributes to the net art experience - a unique situation, not\r\n              often present in other media, and one that decentralises and\r\n              breaks down hierarchies of authorship (Greene 2004) [4]. Net art\r\n              challenges preconceived notions of what the web is, how it works\r\n              and how users participate and experience life online. 4 key\r\n              factors that designers must take into consideration when designing\r\n              for the online environment are: Invisible design elements,\r\n              collaborative participation, anarchic structure and non-linear\r\n              communication.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              From the Form Art perspectives, web interface design should\r\n              consider invisible or hidden design elements in terms of forming a\r\n              user experience. Net artists do not define their works as artworks\r\n              displayed on the screen or in the browser but use the technology\r\n              inherent on the Internet as intrinsic elements of the art they\r\n              produce. The beauty of Net art is that it does not construct those\r\n              boundaries between the artists and the user. This is what makes\r\n              Net art a truly interactive communication method where the user\r\n              can participate in any points of the work process so that the user\r\n              can be the artist and vice versa. The boundary between artist and\r\n              audience is blurred when it comes to Net art and some even argue\r\n              that there is no boundary, artist and audience are one and the\r\n              same thing due to the interactive user experience that creates the\r\n              artwork as well as the beauty in it. Artists and audiences become\r\n              equal subjects as partners or coordinators in net art, thus the\r\n              key issue in net art is not distribution and circulation, but\r\n              communication. Communication is the key feature in net art that\r\n              helps us to define and distinguish the boundaries between net\r\n              artist and audience. Net art has no beginning or end, it is\r\n              present continuously. Time based linear story obstructs user\r\n              participation into net art, and this strictly lets users stay as\r\n              the audience.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Net art is a radical form of activism and creativity that\r\n              functions on a perfect platform for communication, design and free\r\n              speech. The JODI site demonstrates that 'net art has become the\r\n              latest stage for artists to construct experimental forms and\r\n              narratives, challenge convention, initiate dialogs, introduce new\r\n              stages, and threaten old paradigms' (Packer 1998). [2] With JODI\r\n              being created in 1994 as one of the first widely recognised and\r\n              praised net artworks, it shows that the platform has so much\r\n              potential for greatness and is one that will continue to impact\r\n              and advance social creativity in our life and the future of many\r\n              others.

It is a place where new ideas can grow and\r\n              political and social movements can gain growth and followers. New\r\n              philosophies can be published, criticised and viewed throughout\r\n              the world. The internet has helped us all as a society to grow, it\r\n              has created worldwide awareness on subjects such as identity,\r\n              equality and inclusiveness. The internet is a powerful tool that\r\n              can be used for good and to spread awareness of global issues, for\r\n              instance, the current war happening between Russia and Ukraine.\r\n              Within minutes of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a large majority of\r\n              the world was already aware of its happening. Due to the influence\r\n              of social media and news networks information spreads extremely\r\n              quickly across the web. This is great for helping to improve\r\n              global connectedness and communication, however, with factors such\r\n              as fake news, the after-effects of colonialism on decolonised\r\n              countries and the world's heavily invested reliance on the\r\n              'internet' there are a few things that must be considered when\r\n              viewing the internet and society. As a developer for these\r\n              platforms, one must always consider what is just in their design\r\n              as well as their design practices.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We are living in a far more progressive, inclusive and open-minded\r\n              society than ever before. Now more than ever we are seeing\r\n              individuals express themselves as who they wish to be, but in\r\n              order for everyone to feel included, especially on the internet,\r\n              it is important that we design with all individuals in mind.\r\n              Social constructs of gender and identity are slowly dissolving and\r\n              it is important for developers to make sure that no individual,\r\n              regardless of their identity, feels left out or injusticed due to\r\n              some design flaw. For instance Sasha Costanza-Chock describes\r\n              their troubling experiences with airport security in their book\r\n              'TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix\r\n              of Domination' [1]. They describes their experience of passing the\r\n              security gates at an airport, due to particular sociotechnical\r\n              configuration of gender normativity (cis-normativity, or the\r\n              assumption that all people have a gender identity that is\r\n              consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth) that has been\r\n              built into the scanner, The device is designed by social standards\r\n              to identify a person passing it as either male or female by the\r\n              genitalia it detects in the scan. There is no space for anything\r\n              inbetween and so it flagged Sasha, prompting them to a physical\r\n              patdown by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer.\r\n              The next issue faced in this situation was the standard of who\r\n              would now search Sasha, as Sasha identifies as a nonbinary, trans,\r\n              femme-presenting person. The general standard is that individual\r\n              would be searched by officer of the same gender. In Sashas case,\r\n              neither of the TSA agents were of the same gender or indentified\r\n              as the same gender as her and so already Sasha was placed in a\r\n              position of embarrassment and humilition that they should not have\r\n              had to go through if these design features were taken into account\r\n              from the start.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              When it comes to justful and inclusive design, designers must use\r\n              their designs to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as\r\n              well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive\r\n              systems[2]. It is our job as designers to creative inclusive\r\n              communities to make sure that no individual is left out or\r\n              unheard. This can be done through education and communication\r\n              which will always lead to greater awareness and hopefully cause\r\n              developers to think more about how they can design more user\r\n              inclusive and just designs globally. It is important that\r\n              developers understand and have a look at the effects of\r\n              colonisation and more importantly decolonisation when considering\r\n              their designs. Colonisation left many countries in states of\r\n              inequality and poverty and because of this it has taken much\r\n              longer for technology to catch up to them. These factors need to\r\n              be thought of by designers in order for their designs to be\r\n              utilized globally. We must consider the infrastructure and\r\n              technological capabilities that other areas in the world might\r\n              have, especially 3rd world countries. We need to think of ways\r\n              that our designs can be utilized effectively and can help promote\r\n              these 3rd world countries in order to improve their everyday\r\n              standard of living. As Designers it is our responsibility to\r\n              ensure a globally inclusive world, that accepts and includes all\r\n              individuals within it. By doing so we can help improve global\r\n              development, communication, education and improve the standard of\r\n              living for everyone within the world.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>By; Matthew Cresswell</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n              [1] Costanza-Chock, S., 2020.

Art and what exactly it is has always been quite a\r\n              controversial topic in history and contemporary philosophy. Even\r\n              the idea of whether art can be defined is itself a rather\r\n              controversial topic. According to the Oxford Dictionary, art is\r\n              the expression or application of human creative skill and\r\n              imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or\r\n              sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their\r\n              beauty or emotional power [1]. Art was always constrained to the\r\n              mediums of pen, paper and the physical environment and so its\r\n              definitions were formed to those constraints. Today we live in a\r\n              digital world, with digital constraints and because of that I\r\n              believe we need to redefine art, move it away from a standard of\r\n              beauty, authenticity and audience. The constraints of art in a\r\n              digital age are dissolved, the definition is far more fluid and\r\n              needs to be examined in further detail.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The French artist Edgar Degas says “Art is not what you see, but\r\n              what you make others see.” I believe this quote quite accurately\r\n              sums up all great art, or at least the purpose of all great\r\n              artworks, regardless of their medium. Art has the power to\r\n              influence, and with this power it can sometimes affect real\r\n              change. An example of this is Leonardo Da Vinci's studies of the\r\n              foetus in the womb. Da Vinci's discoveries and methods went on to\r\n              change the way that both artists and scientists studied the human\r\n              body [2]. In order to explore this concept of what is art and how\r\n              can art in itself effect change, I would like to explore the works\r\n              of two internet artists who were the leading pioneers of web-based\r\n              art, Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands) and\r\n              Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). The pair created\r\n              an art duo in 1994 called JODI, along with a website in 1995 under\r\n              the same name comprising a collection of their digital art, which\r\n              can be visited through the url\r\n              “http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/”.[3][6][10]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              JODI is one of the earliest internet artworks ever created, and\r\n              was one of the founders of the medium. The artistic duo produce\r\n              video and new media works that play with the increasing presence\r\n              of technology in our daily lives. According to Artsy.net JODI\r\n              disrupts and disassembles ubiquitous software, video games, and\r\n              popular internet platforms such as Google Maps and Twitter,\r\n              cultivating coding malfunctions and programming glitches [4]. The\r\n              pair got the idea for the website from code modifications and\r\n              glitches that were implemented or found by the pair in old video\r\n              games like Wolfenstein, Quake and Max Payne 2. [3]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The page is composed of various intricate landscapes made in basic\r\n              HTML. The website shares the appearance of most pre 2000 viruses\r\n              and upon my first visit to the website I believed I myself had\r\n              encountered a computer virus rather than a digital artwork.\r\n              However, that is all this website is, a series of non-functional,\r\n              non-threatening, visually stimulating works of digital art created\r\n              through HTML. The artworks are interactable to some degree, many\r\n              you can scroll through and move around, and there are various\r\n              'click points'/ 'hyperlinks' set up in each artwork that will take\r\n              you to another artwork or page when clicked on. I found the\r\n              artwork to be very appealing visually as it appeals to my taste in\r\n              retro 90's fashion, through its use of the generic RGB (Red,\r\n              Green, Blue) colour scheme, and its 'hacker' style of presentation\r\n              that reminds me of a command terminal.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              JODI was the winner of the 1999 Webby Awards in the category of\r\n              Net Art. A tradition of the Webby awards is that every winner of\r\n              the Webby awards is granted a “5-word acceptance speech” and the\r\n              creators of JODI chose “Ugly Commercial Sons of Bitches”.[3] The\r\n              intention of the JODI artists in this statement were to criticise\r\n              the creators of the Webby awards who, although, promote and help\r\n              advertise the art and net art community, aid in detracting from\r\n              the value of the artwork. The artists said of JODI “We decided to\r\n              put the work immediately on the screen, without our press releases\r\n              and without our bio. We don't use our site to present information.\r\n              We present screens and things that are happening in these screens.\r\n              We avoid explanations. Look at any exhibition: People are sniffing\r\n              on the information plates next to the art works, before they look\r\n              at the work itself. They want to know who did a piece, before they\r\n              have an opinion about it. As long as we can we try to avoid\r\n              that.”[5] The creators of JODI created the work of art with\r\n              intention. There is meaning behind their craft and that is what\r\n              they want to highlight more than anything else. The creators were\r\n              not looking for fame or fortune in their creation, they created it\r\n              as art for the sake of art, to deliver a message. Walter Benjamin\r\n              claims in his book The work of art in the age of mechanical\r\n              reproduction that “works of art are received and valued on\r\n              different planes. Two types stand out; with one, the accent is on\r\n              the cult value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the\r\n              work.”[9] The artwork was not created for exhibition as it had no\r\n              physical medium, it was a one on one experience with the user and\r\n              their computer. The artwork's value was entirely based on its cult\r\n              value. JODI's intention is to expose the backside of the internet,\r\n              the dangers of it, the beauty of it, the way it works and all the\r\n              hidden elements it contains. One can think of the artwork as a\r\n              metaphor of the World Wide Web (WWW). The work highlights that\r\n              code is behind everything on the web.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              When creating the website the artists made a very simple mistake\r\n              of forgetting a forward slash in the first command. Due to this,\r\n              the drawing on the page was broken, incorrectly spaced and all\r\n              over the place. [6] At first the developers thought there was\r\n              something wrong with their computer but after some trial and error\r\n              decided that the effect was quite interesting and decided to\r\n              publish it online. Due to this, the mistake was reproduced\r\n              endlessly and eventually everyone saw the exact same mistake. By\r\n              daring to make that mistake, they made the code the subject of the\r\n              piece.[5] This drew the audience's attention to the source code of\r\n              that webpage, which when requested to view in one's browser\r\n              reveals the correct version of the drawing. Many users attempted\r\n              to figure out what the code written on the source page is. A user\r\n              from Everything Cyber Wiki analysed the code, a cluster of green\r\n              text, and found it be an ascii encoding of a schematic for a\r\n              Hydrogen (atomic) Bomb.[7] Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk the\r\n              creators of JODI said “That hidden layer was a very interesting\r\n              way to draw attention to the code, which is inevitably behind\r\n              everything.” [8] When clicking on the green text the user is taken\r\n              to a new webpage which is a topographical map that includes\r\n              various names, messages and an IP address with the text “Betalab”\r\n              above. The same user on Everything Cyber Wiki discovered that\r\n              Betalab is a research lab in DC and that this IP address,\r\n              131.24.167, is the IP address for an air force base in Alabama.\r\n              Apparently there is no danger behind this information and that it\r\n              was added to draw controversy to the website.[7]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In a time before pop-up blockers and anti-virus programs, users\r\n              who visited the website JODI would be spammed with a series of\r\n              pop-up windows that would take a picture of your desktop and\r\n              manipulate into different variants. If the user attempted to stop\r\n              it they would just be redirected to a different variant. The\r\n              software did no real harm to the user's computer and was only\r\n              implemented to frighten the user. Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk\r\n              the creators of JODI said “There was, however, no real\r\n              manipulation of the computer at a deeper level. For us, the\r\n              computer's graphic interface was sufficiently interesting.” “It\r\n              was indeed all in the head of the user, because nothing actually\r\n              went wrong. The work was about the user's relationship with the\r\n              mouse, the keyboard, and the monitor. It included three pieces of\r\n              software, three programs, each externally exploring one of those\r\n              elements.”[8]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The intentions of the developers of JODI were to explore the\r\n              various sides of the internet through artworks of software, code\r\n              and digital graphics. What I find most interesting about the\r\n              artwork is the variations that stemmed as a result of its\r\n              creation. Many users on the internet saw this website as a\r\n              brilliant opportunity to create replicas that would actually\r\n              infect your computer with viruses. By hiding themselves under the\r\n              ploy of this artwork hundreds of false sights were created under\r\n              similar domains as the original JODI, to the point where even\r\n              today if you only search “joid.org” in your browser you will come\r\n              across a seemingly endless series of websites that all look the\r\n              same but not identical to the original artwork. Most of the time\r\n              you are sent to the original site, and other times you are sent to\r\n              later works of the artists, but it is an endless expanse of\r\n              artwork and glitches for one to explore if they are brave enough.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Walter Benjamin said in his book The work of art in the age of\r\n              mechanical reproduction “In principle, a work of art has always\r\n              been reproducible. Man-made artefacts could always be imitated by\r\n              men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by\r\n              masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties\r\n              in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of art,\r\n              however, represents something new.” JODI is a website that has\r\n              reproduced many replicas and in some ways due to its creation\r\n              created a whole new medium of art, net art. The artists were\r\n              experimenting with the creation of a mass medium “In that sense,\r\n              we are producing a work that pins the honest expression of all\r\n              these people against our ideas about art. It is the age-old story\r\n              of the artist who is jealous of the nonartist, because he or she\r\n              can formulate his or her expressions in a very direct way.”[8]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Art's value is discerned from its authenticity, replicas hold\r\n              little to no value in the world of art. This is what made the\r\n              world of net art so controversial. One could copy a website or a\r\n              piece of net art to a degree of indiscernible inditcality. The\r\n              only thing that one had power over was a domain and an IP address\r\n              which could link the authenticity of a website, however, this was\r\n              still not entirely safe. Most art holds value in authenticity\r\n              because “this unique existence of the work of art determined the\r\n              history to which it was subject throughout the time of its\r\n              existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in\r\n              physical condition over the years as well as the various changes\r\n              in its ownership.”[9] JODI does not degrade in time nor does it\r\n              suffer damage from the weather and wear. The artwork remains\r\n              intact throughout its entire life and is even editable, meaning it\r\n              can be improved. So where does the value in JODI lie?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The developers of JODI said “Well, if I look at our work\r\n              retrospectively, the basic idea might be to get a better insight\r\n              into the ways a computer system functions, or rather, how you can\r\n              tell stories through all kinds of symbolic tricks. Through\r\n              manipulation, you can discover how the machine is constructed; how\r\n              it is trying to have you believe that something cannot be done\r\n              differently. We show that it can certainly be done\r\n              differently!”[8] So JODI is an expression of how things can be\r\n              done differently. It is a statement that we can express things in\r\n              any way we choose, the fact that it was an entirely new medium for\r\n              that time is proof of, the creators wanted to do things\r\n              differently.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Walter Benjamin states that “The authenticity of a thing is the\r\n              essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging\r\n              from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history\r\n              which it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on\r\n              the authenticity, the former, too, is jeopardised by reproduction\r\n              when substantive duration ceases to matter. And what is really\r\n              jeopardised when the historical testimony is affected is the\r\n              authority of the object.”[9] so if this authenticity of a thing is\r\n              jeopardised by its historical authenticity how has JODI managed to\r\n              maintain its authenticity? The website has had to switch its\r\n              domain on various occasions, hence the series of www’s in the URL.\r\n              However, it has maintained its authenticity through its\r\n              uniqueness. The fact that it is the original website when you find\r\n              it, gives its value. The fact that so many replicas exist do not\r\n              detract from the value of the original website. The others are all\r\n              works of art in their own right, even if they do have malicious\r\n              intentions.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The value of the website stands on its own, on its domain. This is\r\n              entirely new for the world of art as previous replicas of art held\r\n              little value, however now they stand entirely on their own as\r\n              individual works to be experienced and appreciated. The beauty of\r\n              the artwork is that it is not limited by a physical domain, you\r\n              don't have to go to a museum to see the original, all you need is\r\n              a computer with an internet connection. Walter Benjamin speaks on\r\n              the value of replicas and artworks with regard to their\r\n              authenticity and says that “secondly, technical reproduction can\r\n              put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of\r\n              reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original\r\n              to meet the beholder halfway.”[9] So with JODI there is no need to\r\n              meet halfway, one can experience the original anywhere as long as\r\n              they have the technological means. This introduced an entirely new\r\n              element to the world of art, it brought art to the audience.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I believe that JODI is a perfect example of art in the digital age\r\n              and sufficiently allows us to explore the medium of art and what\r\n              it is. Art is an experience that the viewer has with a creation.\r\n              The audience experiences its message, its history and its value\r\n              whether that be cultural, historical, political or monetary, all\r\n              art holds value and it is there to be experienced. This is what\r\n              makes art, art.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              [1] Plato.stanford.edu. 2007.

Whether it be through music and mixing songs to design sounds and emotions, through the creation of this website, or even through the cup of coffee I make each morning. I feel like we are all constantly designing. The outfits we wear and messages we construct over our phones are all products of design. And it seems the more and more we design the more beautiful this world is becoming.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            “Design is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order” according to Victor Papanek in his book Design for human scale. In it, he states that all men are designers. Personally, I agree with this statement, but I feel like this statement is not broad enough. I believe that all Beings are designers. Not just humans, all living creatures design. A great example of this is the ornate and beautiful geometric designs created in the sand by the male puffer fish in the seas of Japan, in order to attract a mate. The infinitely present fractals found all over the world and in every aspect of nature and natural design. From mountains, to coastlines to river structures. In the delicate and iterative shapes of snowflakes and the beautiful spirals that nature tends to follow.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            There is design in everything. Papanek says “We constantly try to understand our ever-changingly highly complex existence by seeking order in it. And what we seek we find.” There is pattern and design all around us, it can be seen in the perfect hexagons of honeycombs or how often the Fibonacci sequence presents itself so perfectly in nature. A great example of this can be seen in the petals of flowers. Most have 3 (like lilies), 5 (like parnassia), 8 (like cosmea), or 13 (like daisies). This goes on and you will always find that the number of petals a flower has (if not damaged) corresponds to one of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Design is highly integrated into nature, everything has a purpose and happens for a reason, and as Papanek says “The reason we enjoy things in nature is that we see an economy of means, simplicity, elegance, and an essential rightness there.”\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            There is always a reason for the design, no matter how simple. But beauty in design cannot be truly be achieved without understanding the function of the design, the reason for it to be created in the first place. Papanek highlights this point in his writings when he states that “The mode of action by which a design fulfills its purpose is its function”. I find this to be highly useful when designing anything myself. I personally feel like I can’t start to create a good design before I know what the function of that design is.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              A point that Papanek so clearly defines in his writings is that design must be ‘meaningful’ as we as humans respond to that which has meaning. And in order to create this meaning, we must make correct use of the tools, materials, and processes we have at hand in our environment.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>By: Matthew Cresswell</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p> Papanek, V., 1983.

Due to its large ethnic and cultural diversity many different traditions and practices have been established, and due to this many forms of creation and art. What is most unique about the art that comes from Africa in comparison to the rest of the world, is that it is mostly created due to societal needs or as a form of creativity, tradition and expression, rather than a means of wealth… It was created as art with a purpose [1]. Many different forms of art stem from Africa, these include Basket making, beadworking, painting, carving, sculpting and so much more. There has always been a large focus on the aesthetic design of African artworks and much interest has been taken in its shapes, colours, uses and meanings. However, very little focus has been put into the technical and mathematical systems, as well as the cultural and political impacts, underlying the design of such artworks.  \r\n</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>In recent years more research has been done around African art and the mathematical constructs involving its creation, particularly fractal geometry. Ron Eglash, an author and professor who is widely known for his works in ethnomathematics, ethnocomputing and the diverse relationships between mathematics and culture, writes on the prevalence of Fractals in African Culture in his book “African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigineous Design”[2]. Research has shown some rather interesting results, and it indicates that fractals are well entangled in the roots of african art and design. Fractal and mathematical design has been found in traditional ways of constructing homesteads, pattern generation, designing sigils and religious rites. The presence of these mathematical forms in the core design of cultural and societal artefacts suggests a far more advanced understanding of mathematics in early African society than was widely thought[3]. Attention can be drawn to the structural patterns of pre colonial African settlements which tend to follow a fractal design, this Egland says, is simply due to the fact that fractal design is widely present in African culture and its design practices.\r\n</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>In an attempt to further understand this fractal design within African art, I visited the Wits Art Museum which is known to have an extensive collection of African art and history. My visit was enjoyable, however, not as insightful as I thought it would be. I struggled to find fractal design present in the majority of the artworks such as the paintings and sculptures, which just appeared to be abstract or of creative influence rather than mathematical in design. In the beadwork I could find occurrences of iteration and multiple occurrences of linear scaling and particularly in the use of linear-concentrically scaled triangles that were present in almost all of the beadwork items in the museum. I still wasn’t too convinced as these items followed very basic iterative sets such as 1,2,3,4,... which is a very basic set of iteratively scaled numbers and not so much true recursion.</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>The traditional handwoven baskets, however, were laced with evidence of recursion, fractals and fractal integrated design. The traditional zulu baskets are made from ilala palm fronds which are stripped and dyed using natural materials such as mud, flowers, charcoal, bark, roots and other materials found in the area [4]. These baskets were used to store food and grain, as well as to carry alcohol and other liquids. The larger baskets are often woven by brides-to-be or given as wedding gifts and require significantly more time and effort to make and can sometimes take up to an entire year to complete. More elaborately designed and intricately patterned baskets denote the relative wealth and power of the family that owns it.\r\n</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>The Fibonacci spiral or more accurately Archimedean spiral of the baskets weaved spines was present in all the designs of the baskets at the museum. One basket followed a beautiful iterative pattern of increasingly larger diamonds, each a different colour. The diamonds on the basket are said to represent femininity and a string of diamonds represents the shield of Shaka.When viewed vertically the spine that the basket follows when being made follows the shape of an archimedean spiral. Due to the presence of this spiral at the base of its construction it can be seen that the baskets follow a scaling design and are designed to follow an eulerian path when being created (Centre-outwards, or top-to-bottom). The presence of recursion in both the design and aesthetics of the basket are excellent examples of the prevalence of fractal design in African culture. A bowl that was placed at the end of the exhibition, made for the 1995 rugby world cup, was created in a beautiful archimedean spiral shape and was made up of linearly-scaled rings or linearly-concentric circles of different colours. \r\n</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>I found these examples to be good accounts of fractal geometry present within African culture, however, I wasn't fully satisfied with this evidence. Upon doing more research I found a picture of a flat bowl stored at the Wits Art Museum created by Esta Zulu, a Tintsaba (Master Weavers) from eSwatini. The artwork's name is “Spiralling Energy” and it was created in 2014. The bowl is woven from agave sisalana (sisal) and lutindzi grass, both common plants found in Southern Africa. The bowl has a beautiful black archimedean spiral across its surface. No other patterns or geometrics are present on the bowl besides the spiral. The bowl is a beautiful construct composed entirely of archimedean spirals [5]. The actual material of the bowel is laced together in an archimedean spiral, with the bowl being created from the inner point and expanding outwards. The spiral on the bowl is entirely fractal in nature as its shape is that of a point moving on a line that is rotated uniformly about the origin (an Archemedian spiral) and the spiral is composed of a sequence of lines that iteratively increase in width as it expands outwards from the centre of the bowl. I believe that this bowl is a perfect example of fractal design in African culture and is so relevant to the subject that one could even consider it a caricature of fractal design in African art. I believe the artist wanted to place focus on the nature of the spiral itself by incorporating a spiral into every element of its design, she is commenting on that nature of the spiral in our everyday lives. It is a commonly known fact that the fibonacci sequence can be found in almost all of nature, and I feel that this bowl highlights that.\r\n</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>These bowls and baskets were not designed to represent the nature of fractals in a physical manner, in fact these bowls follow fractal design because this is what made the design of these pieces possible. They are just rules and processes that these cultures follow and have found to work and therefore they have integrated them into their society. The evidence of iterative design in Africa is widely prevalent from the designs in straw walls, to settlement construction. The Chokwe people of Angola have a tradition of drawing eulerian paths in the sand. This was done as an age based initiation system, which one would have to learn at a certain age. This allowed for iterations of knowledge to be passed from one generation to another and to allow for more knowledge to be shared and gained as one grew older.</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>The evidence I have provided above is sufficient enough to say that fractals are deeply woven in the history and culture of Africa, and that African fractals are not just the result of spontaneous intuition but are, however, ingrained in African tradition as rule-bound techniques that can be seen as equivalent to Western mathematics. The significance of the presence of fractals in African history is that it can help to break down long held myths and misconceptions of Africans being inactive agents in history that have contributed little to the global fields of science, technology and mathematics. This enate mathematical design shows that the African peoples were significantly more advanced than is widely believed, and had a far better understanding of mathematics, patterns, and self-organisation. By examining and understanding these design decisions and traditions of iterative and mathematically influenced design, we can break down racist mindsets by helping to decompose connotations that African cultures were not technologically advanced and had little understanding of mathematics, and can help to find many strategies to promote technological research, self organisation, and egalitarianism.\r\n</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>[1]Collections.dma.org. 2022.

In grade 10 I was introduced to the idea of imaginary\r\n              numbers or i the square root of -1 (√-1). This number is\r\n              theoretically impossible, but through a series of logical\r\n              inductions one can arrive at a proof that √-1 does in fact exist.\r\n              This blew my mind and I was immediately invested in the concept.\r\n              After doing more research on the topic of i, I came across an\r\n              interesting topic, fractals, which are produced by an equation\r\n              using the number i. The idea is that a fractal is something that\r\n              is built from infinitely smaller parts of itself. A fractal is a\r\n              never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns\r\n              that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by\r\n              repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback\r\n              loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems\r\n              – they are the images of pure Chaos.[1]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Fractals exist geometrically between our familiar dimensions (the\r\n              real numbers plane). Fractals can be found in all areas of life,\r\n              and they occur quite commonly in nature as well. In nature\r\n              fractals can be seen in plants, trees, rivers, coastlines,\r\n              mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes and so much more. These\r\n              more natural fractals often follow sets succh as the golden spiral\r\n              which are based off a number sequence known as the fibonacci\r\n              sequence. however, abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set\r\n              – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation\r\n              over and over. This is what my focuses is on, abstract fractals\r\n              and most particularly the Mandelbrot Set.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The equation for a Mandelbrot set generally looks like this{\" \"}\r\n              <i>\r\n                <b>\r\n                  i<sub>n+1</sub> = i<sub>n</sub>\r\n                  <sup>2</sup> + c\r\n                </b>\r\n              </i>\r\n              . In this equation, c and i are complex or imaginary numbers and n\r\n              is zero or any positive integer (i.e. natural number). What this\r\n              equation basically means is that the next i value in the set is\r\n              equal to its previous i value square plus some complex number, c.\r\n              The equation is built upon sets of itself essentially. The\r\n              equation was discovered by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1979 [2]. Using\r\n              IBM’s computers, he was able to use computer graphics to create\r\n              and display fractal geometric images, this allowed him to show how\r\n              visual complexity can be created from simple rules.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I have found fractals to be one of the most beautiful and complex\r\n              things I have ever seen. Therefore, the net art I have chosen to\r\n              create is a website that allows one to view a Mandelbrot fractal.\r\n              The purpose of the website is to give a good understanding of what\r\n              fractals are and then to allow one to view a fractal in detail. I\r\n              have researched various fractal generators online, most cost money\r\n              and are quite complex to use. They work off of applications that\r\n              run the software as an application on your computer. These include\r\n              websites like Mandelbulb 3D, Apophysis and XenoDream [3][4][5].\r\n              However, I was able to find some websites that allowed you to\r\n              generate and view fractals. The first was{\" \"}\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://sciencevsmagic.net/fractal/#0060,0090,1,1,0,0,1\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                Science vs. Magic\r\n              </a>\r\n              [6], and is a fantastic website that teaches you how fractals are\r\n              built from recursion and iterative feedback loops. The website\r\n              uses line algorithms and builds upon them to create very intricate\r\n              and beautiful equations. The{\" \"}\r\n              <a href=\"http://usefuljs.net/fractals/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n                UsefulJs’ online fractal generator\r\n              </a>{\" \"}\r\n              [7] website is another very good website that allows one to view\r\n              various fractal sets such as the mandelbrot set in great detail\r\n              and it also allows you to alter the equation used to produce the\r\n              set, in order to produce new sets.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              With my website I will look for an external Javascript plugin that\r\n              will allow me to generate a Mandelbrot fractal set that the viewer\r\n              of the webpage can explore in great detail. I will use a fractal\r\n              generator to produce and extremely high resolution fractal image\r\n              that the user can zoom into in order to see how a fractal is built\r\n              upon infinite parts of itself. I feel the best way to understand\r\n              exactly what a fractal is, is to see it and explore its parts. I\r\n              personally love to watch videos of fractal sets rendered by super\r\n              computers. They are beautiful and the way they continue to create\r\n              themselves endlessly is super entertaining to watch and quite\r\n              relaxing. I feel I may occur some technical concerns here when it\r\n              comes to implementing the fractal generator on the website as the\r\n              code is complex and will be tricky to understand and utilize for\r\n              my own purposes. However, I will do further research into external\r\n              fractal plugins for javascript and react.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I hope that by creating this website, I will be able to explore\r\n              fractals further and gain a deeper grasp and understanding of what\r\n              they are, how they are created and there purposes in all areas of\r\n              life. I hope to share the love I have for fractals through my\r\n              website and hopefully create that love in you too.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              [1] Fractalfoundation.org. n.d.

I am in the\r\n              prototyping phase of development. For this release of the\r\n              prototype I have been working on implementing a fractal generator\r\n              plugin that will allow the viewer to view a detailed Mandelbrot\r\n              set. The plugin uses an open source GNU general public license\r\n              javascript application that generates the MandelBrot fractal\r\n              through an algorithm created by Raphael Pedicini. The code is\r\n              split into two independent parts: app.js and fractal.js. The app\r\n              handles all the setup and user interaction, and communicates these\r\n              to the fractal using the fractal's api. The fractal just\r\n              calculates and draws itself based on the settings it receives from\r\n              the app. I have been working on implementing the code into my\r\n              website, however it is extremely complex and has taken quite some\r\n              time to get my head around. Therefore, I have decided that for\r\n              this prototype I will not include the fractal generator and will\r\n              instead include it in the final release of the website. I feel\r\n              this is necessary as the website still needs work in places\r\n              elsewhere and as I will need more time to get the fractal\r\n              generator working, I feel it would be best to work on these areas\r\n              of improvement so that the website is almost entirely complete\r\n              without the fractal generator. This will allow me to focus my\r\n              efforts on getting the fractal generator working for the final\r\n              release and allow me to complete the rest of the website in the\r\n              meantime.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              For this release there are a few bugs that I need to fix. The\r\n              first is my images which are too large and dont link correctly in\r\n              certain areas. I would like to add an individual viewing window\r\n              for each of my blogs so one does not have to scroll so much, and\r\n              possibly add a back to the top button on my blog page. I will\r\n              implement a footer to the website with copyright information and\r\n              my personal information for contact purposes. I will fill the site\r\n              will all the necessary information to make it feel more populated\r\n              and complete. I have designed the website to have feels of both\r\n              early html mathematics websites, through the simple text styles\r\n              and isolated areas of text and image, and modern ‘ios’ like\r\n              applications through the navbar design and simple but clean User\r\n              Interface.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              As of this moment the website does not particularly stand as an\r\n              interactable artwork, although it may be very visually stimulating\r\n              and appealing making it appear ‘artsy’, it is still not yet fully\r\n              interactable as the main point of the website, the fractal\r\n              generator, will not be available yet. However, I do believe as it\r\n              is now the website provides a beautiful insight into the art of\r\n              fractals and displays their beauty in very efficient and simple\r\n              manner. For the final release of the website, the fractal\r\n              generator will be working and then I believe the website can be\r\n              termed a brilliant example of an internet artwork.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By: Matthew Cresswell</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div id=\"blog5\" className=\"Reflection\">\r\n            <h2>A detailed reflection of the creation of my website</h2>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Fractally is a website that looks at Fractals in all their wonder.\r\n              I have always been interested in fractals and how they are created\r\n              and wanted to learn more about creating them myself. I thought\r\n              this website to be a brilliant opportunity to do just that. So my\r\n              focus for this first iteration of the website “Fractally” was to\r\n              deploy a basic website that had the skeleton for all the features\r\n              I wish to implement on the website in the future. I believe I have\r\n              achieved this goal as all features, pages and tools that I wish to\r\n              use have been created and set up.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I began creation of the website with a navigation bar that was\r\n              made using React States and by deciding which tabs I wanted to\r\n              display. I created the Navbar and then made the navbar responsive\r\n              for different screen sizes by changing it from a bar at the top of\r\n              the screen to a Side navigation bar that can be toggled on and\r\n              off. I felt this would look very good on mobile devices and would\r\n              help make things look sleaker by removing all the extra text in\r\n              the Navbar at the top of the screen and allowing the user ot\r\n              utilise it only when navigation is needed.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I linked all the navbar buttons to their respective pages using\r\n              react routing. From here I added the basic design for each page.\r\n              As a feature to test react props, I created a 'Mini Window'\r\n              prop/function that allows me to place an image and some text in a\r\n              nice box that is interactable and can navigate me to different\r\n              parts of my website. I use this Mini Window on my homepage to\r\n              display my Blogs as I felt it was a nice to way to organise them\r\n              and draw the user towards them without the user being scared off\r\n              by walls of text.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              My Blog page contains all my blogs that I have written this year,\r\n              each separated into their own boxes using css. The Fractals page\r\n              only has my wireframes in it as of this moment, However, in the\r\n              feature I wish to make it a page with lots of interesting facts\r\n              and information fractals.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Finally my Fractal Viewer page which can be access by 2 buttons,\r\n              the Fractal Viewer button and the Start button on the homepage.\r\n              This is going to be the main feature of my website and the aspect\r\n              that will make it a Net art and not just an ordinary website about\r\n              fractals. I wish to create a program that will generate a\r\n              mandelbrot fractal set that the user can view when in the Fractal\r\n              Viewer page. By doing so I hope to allow my users to see the\r\n              beauty and unimaginable infiniteness of fractals. I have found\r\n              various open source programs that create mandelbrot fractals and\r\n              have been looking at using these in conjunction with myt website\r\n              to create and even more spectacular library of fractals.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The website has all features of its skeleton/framework in place.\r\n              What is left is for me to add a footer to the website with\r\n              information about myself and the website itself. The main focus of\r\n              the next iteration of this website will be on creating the\r\n              mandelbrot fractal viewer.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"Reflection2\">\r\n          <h2>Reflection 2 of Fractally, a website about Fractals.</h2>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            The website has shown significant progress and is in a state where I can say it is almost complete and functional as my own fractal inspired website. The website is almost entirely functional with only the Fractal Viewer component that still needs to be implemented and hyperlinks to my social media accounts. Otherwise, the page is fully responsive for PC and mobile and has all the information in it that I believe gives you a good understanding of what fractals are and some great examples of fractals themselves.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            My focus for this release was understanding the fractal plugin and to fill the website with the rest of the needed content. I have made a lot of progress in understanding the code and algorithms written by Rafael Pedicini. I have a fractal.html file in my src folder that allows the user to view the fractal generator, however, I am still in the process of applying this plugin to my main website. The code is extremely complex and has taken me sometime to understand. I will not be able to have a working version of the plugin available in time for this submission so I focused my efforts on my writing and the content of the website. I have added videos and pictures of fractals as well as some useful information about fractals in the fractal page of my website. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            I focused on finding the style of my website, which is a clean simple ios like interface that uses Times new roman font to create a mathematical feel to the website. The text and images are isolated from each other and will not appear next to each other, only above or below. I have created individual blog pages for each of my blogs, I felt it was tedious and time consuming to scroll through all the blogs on the webpage so to fix this issue I created the individual blog pages that allow you to view each blog in an isolated tab.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            I felt that a footer was necessary to make the website look professional and ‘complete’. Therefore, I added a simple footer that includes my contact information and social media links, however, the hyperlinks to my social media pages do not work yet. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n            For the final release of the website I will incorporate the fractal generator software to the Fractal Viewer page of my website. I will dedicate my time on this one issue as I feel it is the most important part of the website and it needs to be included in some way or another. I am happy with the progress of my website this far, I feel it has all the necessary information about fractals that one will need to gain a basic understanding of them, with out going into serious detail regarding the maths and the algorithms used to create fractals. With the final release of the website I feel I will have created an impactful net artwork that incorporates all the elements and beauty of fractals.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              By: Matthew Cresswell\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default Blogs"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
