The internet has helped us all as a society to grow, it has created worldwide awareness on subjects such as identity, equality and inclusiveness. The internet is a powerful tool that can be used for good and to spread awareness of global issues, for instance, the current war happening between Russia and Ukraine. Within minutes of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a large majority of the world was already aware of its happening. Due to the influence of social media and news networks information spreads extremely quickly across the web. This is great for helping to improve global connectedness and communication, however, with factors such as fake news, the after-effects of colonialism on decolonised countries and the world's heavily invested reliance on the 'internet' there are a few things that must be considered when viewing the internet and society.

Social constructs of gender and identity are slowly dissolving and it is important for developers to make sure that no individual, regardless of their identity, feels left out or injusticed due to some design flaw. For instance Sasha Costanza-Chock describes their troubling experiences with airport security in their book 'TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix of Domination' [1]. They describes their experience of passing the security gates at an airport, due to particular sociotechnical configuration of gender normativity (cis-normativity, or the assumption that all people have a gender identity that is consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth) that has been built into the scanner, The device is designed by social standards to identify a person passing it as either male or female by the genitalia it detects in the scan. There is no space for anything inbetween and so it flagged Sasha, prompting them to a physical patdown by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer. The next issue faced in this situation was the standard of who would now search Sasha, as Sasha identifies as a nonbinary, trans, femme-presenting person. The general standard is that individual would be searched by officer of the same gender. In Sashas case, neither of the TSA agents were of the same gender or indentified as the same gender as her and so already Sasha was placed in a position of embarrassment and humilition that they should not have had to go through if these design features were taken into account from the start.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 32,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"br\", {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 64,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n      children: \"When it comes to justful and inclusive design, designers must use their designs to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems[2].
