Art and what exactly it is has always been quite a controversial topic in history and contemporary philosophy. Even the idea of whether art can be defined is itself a rather controversial topic. According to the Oxford Dictionary, art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power [1]. Art was always constrained to the mediums of pen, paper and the physical environment and so its definitions were formed to those constraints. Today we live in a digital world, with digital constraints and because of that I believe we need to redefine art, move it away from a standard of beauty, authenticity and audience.

Da Vinci's discoveries and methods went on to change the way that both artists and scientists studied the human body [2]. In order to explore this concept of what is art and how can art in itself effect change, I would like to explore the works of two internet artists who were the leading pioneers of web-based art, Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands) and Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium).

The artwork's value was entirely based on its cult value. JODI's intention is to expose the backside of the internet, the dangers of it, the beauty of it, the way it works and all the hidden elements it contains.

Due to this, the drawing on the page was broken, incorrectly spaced and all over the place. [6] At first the developers thought there was something wrong with their computer but after some trial and error decided that the effect was quite interesting and decided to publish it online. Due to this, the mistake was reproduced endlessly and eventually everyone saw the exact same mistake. By daring to make that mistake, they made the code the subject of the piece.[5] This drew the audience's attention to the source code of that webpage, which when requested to view in one's browser reveals the correct version of the drawing. Many users attempted to figure out what the code written on the source page is. A user from Everything Cyber Wiki analysed the code, a cluster of green text, and found it be an ascii encoding of a schematic for a Hydrogen (atomic) Bomb.[7] Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk the creators of JODI said \\u201CThat hidden layer was a very interesting way to draw attention to the code, which is inevitably behind everything.\\u201D [8] When clicking on the green text the user is taken to a new webpage which is a topographical map that includes various names, messages and an IP address with the text \\u201CBetalab\\u201D above. The same user on Everything Cyber Wiki discovered that Betalab is a research lab in DC and that this IP address, 131.24.167, is the IP address for an air force base in Alabama. Apparently there is no danger behind this information and that it was added to draw controversy to the website.[7]\"}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"p\",{children:\"In a time before pop-up blockers and anti-virus programs, users who visited the website JODI would be spammed with a series of pop-up windows that would take a picture of your desktop and manipulate into different variants.

Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk the creators of JODI said \\u201CThere was, however, no real manipulation of the computer at a deeper level. For us, the computer's graphic interface was sufficiently interesting.\\u201D \\u201CIt was indeed all in the head of the user, because nothing actually went wrong.

Many users on the internet saw this website as a brilliant opportunity to create replicas that would actually infect your computer with viruses. By hiding themselves under the ploy of this artwork hundreds of false sights were created under similar domains as the original JODI, to the point where even today if you only search \\u201Cjoid.org\\u201D in your browser you will come across a seemingly endless series of websites that all look the same but not identical to the original artwork.

Man-made artefacts could always be imitated by men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of art, however, represents something new.\\u201D JODI is a website that has reproduced many replicas and in some ways due to its creation created a whole new medium of art, net art. The artists were experimenting with the creation of a mass medium \\u201CIn that sense, we are producing a work that pins the honest expression of all these people against our ideas about art.

The only thing that one had power over was a domain and an IP address which could link the authenticity of a website, however, this was still not entirely safe. Most art holds value in authenticity because \\u201Cthis unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership.\\u201D[9] JODI does not degrade in time nor does it suffer damage from the weather and wear.

Through manipulation, you can discover how the machine is constructed; how it is trying to have you believe that something cannot be done differently. We show that it can certainly be done differently!\\u201D[8] So JODI is an expression of how things can be done differently. It is a statement that we can express things in any way we choose, the fact that it was an entirely new medium for that time is proof of, the creators wanted to do things differently.\"}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"p\",{children:\"Walter Benjamin states that \\u201CThe authenticity of a thing is the essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history which it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on the authenticity, the former, too, is jeopardised by reproduction when substantive duration ceases to matter. And what is really jeopardised when the historical testimony is affected is the authority of the object.\\u201D[9] so if this authenticity of a thing is jeopardised by its historical authenticity how has JODI managed to maintain its authenticity? The website has had to switch its domain on various occasions, hence the series of www\\u2019s in the URL. However, it has maintained its authenticity through its uniqueness. The fact that it is the original website when you find it, gives its value. The fact that so many replicas exist do not detract from the value of the original website.

The beauty of the artwork is that it is not limited by a physical domain, you don't have to go to a museum to see the original, all you need is a computer with an internet connection. Walter Benjamin speaks on the value of replicas and artworks with regard to their authenticity and says that \\u201Csecondly, technical reproduction can put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original to meet the beholder halfway.\\u201D[9] So with JODI there is no need to meet halfway, one can experience the original anywhere as long as they have the technological means.

One can think of the artwork as a\r\n              metaphor of the World Wide Web (WWW). The work highlights that\r\n              code is behind everything on the web.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              When creating the website the artists made a very simple mistake\r\n              of forgetting a forward slash in the first command. Due to this,\r\n              the drawing on the page was broken, incorrectly spaced and all\r\n              over the place. [6] At first the developers thought there was\r\n              something wrong with their computer but after some trial and error\r\n              decided that the effect was quite interesting and decided to\r\n              publish it online. Due to this, the mistake was reproduced\r\n              endlessly and eventually everyone saw the exact same mistake. By\r\n              daring to make that mistake, they made the code the subject of the\r\n              piece.[5] This drew the audience's attention to the source code of\r\n              that webpage, which when requested to view in one's browser\r\n              reveals the correct version of the drawing. Many users attempted\r\n              to figure out what the code written on the source page is. A user\r\n              from Everything Cyber Wiki analysed the code, a cluster of green\r\n              text, and found it be an ascii encoding of a schematic for a\r\n              Hydrogen (atomic) Bomb.[7] Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk the\r\n              creators of JODI said “That hidden layer was a very interesting\r\n              way to draw attention to the code, which is inevitably behind\r\n              everything.” [8] When clicking on the green text the user is taken\r\n              to a new webpage which is a topographical map that includes\r\n              various names, messages and an IP address with the text “Betalab”\r\n              above. The same user on Everything Cyber Wiki discovered that\r\n              Betalab is a research lab in DC and that this IP address,\r\n              131.24.167, is the IP address for an air force base in Alabama.\r\n              Apparently there is no danger behind this information and that it\r\n              was added to draw controversy to the website.[7]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In a time before pop-up blockers and anti-virus programs, users\r\n              who visited the website JODI would be spammed with a series of\r\n              pop-up windows that would take a picture of your desktop and\r\n              manipulate into different variants. If the user attempted to stop\r\n              it they would just be redirected to a different variant. The\r\n              software did no real harm to the user's computer and was only\r\n              implemented to frighten the user. Dirk Paesmans and Joan Heemskerk\r\n              the creators of JODI said “There was, however, no real\r\n              manipulation of the computer at a deeper level. For us, the\r\n              computer's graphic interface was sufficiently interesting.” “It\r\n              was indeed all in the head of the user, because nothing actually\r\n              went wrong. The work was about the user's relationship with the\r\n              mouse, the keyboard, and the monitor. It included three pieces of\r\n              software, three programs, each externally exploring one of those\r\n              elements.”[8]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The intentions of the developers of JODI were to explore the\r\n              various sides of the internet through artworks of software, code\r\n              and digital graphics. What I find most interesting about the\r\n              artwork is the variations that stemmed as a result of its\r\n              creation. Many users on the internet saw this website as a\r\n              brilliant opportunity to create replicas that would actually\r\n              infect your computer with viruses. By hiding themselves under the\r\n              ploy of this artwork hundreds of false sights were created under\r\n              similar domains as the original JODI, to the point where even\r\n              today if you only search “joid.org” in your browser you will come\r\n              across a seemingly endless series of websites that all look the\r\n              same but not identical to the original artwork. Most of the time\r\n              you are sent to the original site, and other times you are sent to\r\n              later works of the artists, but it is an endless expanse of\r\n              artwork and glitches for one to explore if they are brave enough.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Walter Benjamin said in his book The work of art in the age of\r\n              mechanical reproduction “In principle, a work of art has always\r\n              been reproducible. Man-made artefacts could always be imitated by\r\n              men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by\r\n              masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties\r\n              in the pursuit of gain. Mechanical reproduction of a work of art,\r\n              however, represents something new.” JODI is a website that has\r\n              reproduced many replicas and in some ways due to its creation\r\n              created a whole new medium of art, net art. The artists were\r\n              experimenting with the creation of a mass medium “In that sense,\r\n              we are producing a work that pins the honest expression of all\r\n              these people against our ideas about art. It is the age-old story\r\n              of the artist who is jealous of the nonartist, because he or she\r\n              can formulate his or her expressions in a very direct way.”[8]\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Art's value is discerned from its authenticity, replicas hold\r\n              little to no value in the world of art. This is what made the\r\n              world of net art so controversial. One could copy a website or a\r\n              piece of net art to a degree of indiscernible inditcality. The\r\n              only thing that one had power over was a domain and an IP address\r\n              which could link the authenticity of a website, however, this was\r\n              still not entirely safe. Most art holds value in authenticity\r\n              because “this unique existence of the work of art determined the\r\n              history to which it was subject throughout the time of its\r\n              existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in\r\n              physical condition over the years as well as the various changes\r\n              in its ownership.”[9] JODI does not degrade in time nor does it\r\n              suffer damage from the weather and wear. The artwork remains\r\n              intact throughout its entire life and is even editable, meaning it\r\n              can be improved. So where does the value in JODI lie?\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The developers of JODI said “Well, if I look at our work\r\n              retrospectively, the basic idea might be to get a better insight\r\n              into the ways a computer system functions, or rather, how you can\r\n              tell stories through all kinds of symbolic tricks. Through\r\n              manipulation, you can discover how the machine is constructed; how\r\n              it is trying to have you believe that something cannot be done\r\n              differently. We show that it can certainly be done\r\n              differently!”[8] So JODI is an expression of how things can be\r\n              done differently. It is a statement that we can express things in\r\n              any way we choose, the fact that it was an entirely new medium for\r\n              that time is proof of, the creators wanted to do things\r\n              differently.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Walter Benjamin states that “The authenticity of a thing is the\r\n              essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging\r\n              from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history\r\n              which it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on\r\n              the authenticity, the former, too, is jeopardised by reproduction\r\n              when substantive duration ceases to matter. And what is really\r\n              jeopardised when the historical testimony is affected is the\r\n              authority of the object.”[9] so if this authenticity of a thing is\r\n              jeopardised by its historical authenticity how has JODI managed to\r\n              maintain its authenticity? The website has had to switch its\r\n              domain on various occasions, hence the series of www’s in the URL.\r\n              However, it has maintained its authenticity through its\r\n              uniqueness. The fact that it is the original website when you find\r\n              it, gives its value. The fact that so many replicas exist do not\r\n              detract from the value of the original website. The others are all\r\n              works of art in their own right, even if they do have malicious\r\n              intentions.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The value of the website stands on its own, on its domain. This is\r\n              entirely new for the world of art as previous replicas of art held\r\n              little value, however now they stand entirely on their own as\r\n              individual works to be experienced and appreciated. The beauty of\r\n              the artwork is that it is not limited by a physical domain, you\r\n              don't have to go to a museum to see the original, all you need is\r\n              a computer with an internet connection. Walter Benjamin speaks on\r\n              the value of replicas and artworks with regard to their\r\n              authenticity and says that “secondly, technical reproduction can\r\n              put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of\r\n              reach for the original itself. Above all, it enables the original\r\n              to meet the beholder halfway.”[9] So with JODI there is no need to\r\n              meet halfway, one can experience the original anywhere as long as\r\n              they have the technological means. This introduced an entirely new\r\n              element to the world of art, it brought art to the audience.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I believe that JODI is a perfect example of art in the digital age\r\n              and sufficiently allows us to explore the medium of art and what\r\n              it is. Art is an experience that the viewer has with a creation.\r\n              The audience experiences its message, its history and its value\r\n              whether that be cultural, historical, political or monetary, all\r\n              art holds value and it is there to be experienced. This is what\r\n              makes art, art.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <h3>References:</h3>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>\r\n              [1] Plato.stanford.edu. 2007.
