The artworks compose of various images, videos and pieces of literature that all utilize their digital format to create a unique experience for the audience. The website has an old school retro style layout with various web artworks arranged in a grid. The website is subtle and looks like it was designed in 1997 using HTML 2.0 and Adobe Photoshop and never changed since. I like this as it gives the website the feel of being a true internet archive, and it reminds me of the original 4chan website design in many ways. After browsing the collection of artworks, I came across an image of old english calligraphy that was quite hard to read.I was drawn to the image because the calligraphy reminded me of my high school's church, which had similar calligraphy on the windows. Upon seeing that the words written in calligraphy on the image said \\u201CFaith\\u201D I knew this was the piece of web art I'd been looking for. Clicking on the image takes you to a new page where it gives you information about the artwork and an option to play the piece. \\u201CFaith\\u201D is a web art work described by the author, Robert Kendall, as a kinetic poem. I found this to be very intriguing. In High School, I was a member of the Anglican Church of Benoni and practiced as a Lay Minister at my High School church. Every morning I would read a prayer for the school during morning assemblies and on every Friday I would give a devotion to the school during our weekly Eucharist. I believe strongly that religion is dominated by practice rather than faith and that faith is not spoken about enough. Due to this the majority of my devotionals were focused around having Faith and trusting in the Lord and that you can find true strength in all religions through faith rather than by practice. In my after school hours I was a member of and in matric became the head of our schools creative writers guild. I particularly enjoy writing poetry during this time and have always found it to be my go to method of writing. I really enjoy the rhythm in it and because they are often short pieces I can put intention and meaning into it. This is why I knew that this artwork was the perfect choice.\"}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsxs(\"p\",{children:[\"Upon clicking \\u201CBegin\\u201D to play the artwork a window pops up that asks whether you would like to play the artwork with or without sound. I chose to play with sound in order to capture the full intentions of the author, its poetry after all, everything that is there is there for a reason. The artwork starts with the word 'Faith' written in calligraphy at the top of the screen. The words 'can't', 'logic', 'bend', 'this' float onto the screen and the scene ends with the words 'so\\u2026' appearing at the bottom of the screen which moves you to the next scene if clicked.. Everytime a word of the poem moves a sound is played, making the words of the poem the notes of this poem's song. So this is both a song as well as a poem. I found the words on screen very interesting, \\u201CFaith can't logic bend this\\u201D. In almost all cases of lost faith, it is logic that breaks a person's faith. These words remind me of a conversation I had with an old hippy looking man who was selling tie dye at a psytrance festival back in 2020. I was browsing through his clothing and started to have a conversation with him. I ended up talking to him for around an hour and we discussed various different things, but of all the things we spoke about the one thing that stood out was faith. He told me that humans are, through society, taught not to have faith. One of the first idols or omnipotent beings we are taught to believe in is Santa Claus. Everyone knows who Father Christmas is, and at some stage most of us believed faithfully that Santa Claus was real. But eventually we all have this faith ripped from underneath us, and we learn that our parents are actually Santa. This is the first time in your life that you are taught to place your faith into something false. This is why it is so hard to be faithful, once your trust has been broken once it is very hard to regain, as it is with Faith.

The poem speaks about the author's faith, and his struggles keeping it in today's logic driven society.

I felt that by making the poem a changing and interactable piece it created a unique experience for the viewer, one you could only get digitally or online and that it helped to deliver the author's message far more clearly and precisely. In an article written by David Carrier in 2020, he speaks about the value of digital art and the power the platform has to create a unique and valuable experience.
