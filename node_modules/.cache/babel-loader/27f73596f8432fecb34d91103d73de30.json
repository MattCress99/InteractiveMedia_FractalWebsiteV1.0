Bookchin and Shulgin (1999) describe that net art is 'a self-defining term created by a malfunctioning piece of software, originally used to describe an art and communications activity on the Internet.'

The site is composed of various webpages of internet art that the user can interact with. The site itself doesn't seem to have much functionality besides taking the user through the various webpages of net art. Everything on the site appears to be some form of malfunctioning code or software, however it was intended to look that way by the creators. It is a perfect example of net art as it is online based, highly experimental and at the time it was created, unique. Net artists 'sought to break down autonomous disciplines and outmoded classifications imposed upon various activists practices.' The essence of net art is that it is highly experimental and pushes the boundaries of communication, cultural criticism and technology (Greene 2004) - [4]. The net itself is becoming more than just a browser, they declare that the Net is a temporary autonomous zone that supports anarchy and spontaneity in cyberspace.

The JODI site demonstrates that 'net art has become the\r\n              latest stage for artists to construct experimental forms and\r\n              narratives, challenge convention, initiate dialogs, introduce new\r\n              stages, and threaten old paradigms' (Packer 1998). [2] With JODI\r\n              being created in 1994 as one of the first widely recognised and\r\n              praised net artworks, it shows that the platform has so much\r\n              potential for greatness and is one that will continue to impact\r\n              and advance social creativity in our life and the future of many\r\n              others. Below I have attached links for 3 websites that I believe\r\n              are excellent examples of Net art, I highly recommend going and\r\n              checking them out, you wont regret it!\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/style/leonardo500/ CNN has a\r\n              look at the life of Leonardo Da Vinci and creates a web art\r\n              experience through a visual representation of all his works\r\n              alongside information about him.\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              https://www.erikasenftmiller.com/project/seeking-balance a\r\n              beautiful website designed with animations that act as the\r\n              navigation points of the website.
