The JODI site was created in 1994 by two net artists Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands) and Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium). Bookchin and Shulgin (1999) describe that net art is 'a self-defining term created by a malfunctioning piece of software, originally used to describe an art and communications activity on the Internet.' [1] I feel that the JODI website is a perfect example of this. The website is composed of various fragments of html code that looks like a computer virus that would be depicted in a 90s hacker movie. The site is composed of various webpages of internet art that the user can interact with. The site itself doesn't seem to have much functionality besides taking the user through the various webpages of net art. Everything on the site appears to be some form of malfunctioning code or software, however it was intended to look that way by the creators. It is a perfect example of net art as it is online based, highly experimental and at the time it was created, unique. Net artists 'sought to break down autonomous disciplines and outmoded classifications imposed upon various activists practices.' The essence of net art is that it is highly experimental and pushes the boundaries of communication, cultural criticism and technology (Greene 2004) - [4]. The net itself is becoming more than just a browser, they declare that the Net is a temporary autonomous zone that supports anarchy and spontaneity in cyberspace.

Net art challenges preconceived notions of what the web is, how it works and how users participate and experience life online. 4 key factors that designers must take into consideration when designing for the online environment are: Invisible design elements, collaborative participation, anarchic structure and non-linear communication.\"}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"p\",{children:\"From the Form Art perspectives, web interface design should consider invisible or hidden design elements in terms of forming a user experience. Net artists do not define their works as artworks displayed on the screen or in the browser but use the technology inherent on the Internet as intrinsic elements of the art they produce. The beauty of Net art is that it does not construct those boundaries between the artists and the user. This is what makes Net art a truly interactive communication method where the user can participate in any points of the work process so that the user can be the artist and vice versa. The boundary between artist and audience is blurred when it comes to Net art and some even argue that there is no boundary, artist and audience are one and the same thing due to the interactive user experience that creates the artwork as well as the beauty in it. Artists and audiences become equal subjects as partners or coordinators in net art, thus the key issue in net art is not distribution and circulation, but communication. Communication is the key feature in net art that helps us to define and distinguish the boundaries between net artist and audience. Net art has no beginning or end, it is present continuously.
